Global functioning is assessed by the average of the four previous scores. All scales are scored from zero to 100, with 100 representing the highest level of functioning and least pain.

Items were selected in relation to the different domains of the PUL from proximal to distal performance in order to cover the full range of upper limb functions. The questionnaire consists of 33 items covering four domains (3 points each for Food/Nutrition 7 items, Self Care 8 items, Household/Environment 6 items, Leisure/Communication 12 items).

It measures how the heart deforms throughout the cardiac cycle, and is used to calculate strain on the heart muscle. Peak strain is a measure of distortion in the heart muscle during contraction versus when it is at rest. Mid-ventricular peak circumferential strain is a sensitive marker of cardiac function and can detect effects of therapeutic interventions. Strain is expressed in the negative, so more negative measurements indicate a healthy state while less negative measurements (closer to zero) indicate an unhealthy state."

Each of the 17 items is evaluated on an ordinal scale of 0, 1, or 2, with higher scores reflecting better performance on the assessment, for a total maximum score of 34. This score was transformed to a 0 to 100 scale for the key analysis (referred to as linearized), with higher transformed scores reflecting better performance.The LS mean (LSM) change from baseline standard error was derived using mixed model repeated measures methodology (MMRM) with factors for pooled country, treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction and Day 1 value as baseline covariate.",

It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). The scale assesses activities required to remain functionally ambulant (e.g. rise from the floor), activities that can be difficult even early in the disease (e.g. standing on heels) and activities that are known to progressively deteriorate over time (stand from a chair, walk). NSAA total score was achieved by adding the responses of all activities, ranging from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function and lower score implying more severe symptoms.

Total muscle ribonucleic acid (RNA) was isolated from muscle tissue sections and was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymer chain reaction (RT-PCR). RT-PCR analysis focused on the area flanking the targeted exon 51 was performed to detect specific exon 51 skipping in muscle. Depending on the participants mutation different sets of DMD-gene specific RT and PCR primers were used. Sequence analysis was performed on isolated PCR products to confirm specific exon 51 skip band detection.",

The 25-item PedsQL encompasses 3 scales About My/My Childs Neuromuscular Disease (17 items), Communication (3 items), About Our Family Resources (5 items). A 5-point response scale is utilized (where 0=never a problem; 4=almost always a problem). It was assessed both by child and parent. PedsQL total score was calculated by reverse scoring individual items and linearly transforming the score to a 0-100 scale, where higher scores indicated better health-related quality of life. To reverse score individual items, the 0-4 scale items were transformed to a 0-100 scale as follows: 0=100, 1=75, 2=50, 3=25, and 4=0. Total score was then calculated as sum of items divided by number of items answered. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.

The CGI-I is rated without regard to the clinician's belief that any clinical changes are or are not due to medication and without consideration of the etiology of the symptoms. The CGI-I is measured on a 7-point Likert scale (where 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse).

HUI2 assessed 7 HRQoL dimensions: sensation, mobility, emotion, cognition, self care, pain and fertility. HUI3 assessed 8 HRQoL dimensions: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity, emotion, cognition and pain. Both HUI2 (range from -0.03 to 1.0) and HUI3 (range from -0.36 to 1.0) utility scores were calculated using algorithms incorporating community-derived preference weights. A utility value of 1.0 represented perfect health and a utility value of 0.0 represented death. Lowest possible HUI2 score was -0.03 and for HUI3 score was -0.36, where scores less than 0 represented health states considered worse than death.

Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs included both SAEs and non-serious AEs. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) was defined as an adverse event that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug to 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug.

The sum of these 17 scores was used to form a total score. If fewer than 13 of the 17 activities were performed, the total score was considered missing. If 13 to 16 activities were performed, the total score was calculated by multiplying the sum of the scores in the x activities that were performed by 17/x.

The administration of the EK scale consisted of an interview of the participant to capture how he performs the tasks of daily life (as described by Categories 1 to 9) and how he perceives his wellbeing (as described by Category 10). The interviewer observed the participant and assigned the final score for the tasks that could be observed in the clinic."

The assessment comprised tests for 17 abilities of a participant, such as ability to stand, rise from the floor, get from lying to sitting, get from sitting to standing, raise one's head, stand on one's heels, hop, jump, and run. For each activity, a score of 0, 1, or 2 was recorded, with 0 = \"unable to achieve independently,\" 1 = \"modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another,\" or 2 = \"normal- achieves goal without any assistance.\" The sum of these scores (except for 'raise one's head' activity score) was reported as the ordinal total score, which was transformed to a linear total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).

At post-baseline visit (Week 48), the same participant and/or parent/caregiver was asked to describe any changes from baseline in those activities of daily living/symptoms, within the following categories: physical functioning; general energy level; cognition/school function; emotional/social functioning; and sleep.

The following PODCI domains were prespecified in the protocol for analysis:Transfers/Basic Mobility domain assesses difficulty experienced in performing routine motor activities in daily life. Sports/Physical Functioning domain assesses difficulty encountered in participating in more active recreational activities.

The FACT-C questionnaire contains 9 additional questions on symptoms specific to CRC, 2 of which are only answered by patients with ostomy appliances. These 9 CRC-specific questions are categorized as \"additional concerns\" on the questionnaire and constitute the \"colorectal cancer subscale\" score. The patient self-reports his/her QoL for the previous 7 days. The overall score is calculated across all items and a higher score reflects better quality of life (QoL). The table summarizes the functional well-being subscale, the individual questions are linearly scaled and combined to form the functional well-being subscale score, which ranges from 0-28 (higher is better QoL).",

Response options for each item varied from having no problems to moderate problems or extreme problems. The EQ-5D-5L (v4.0) is a standardized measure of health utility that provides a single index value for one's health status. The EQ-5D-5L is frequently used for economic evaluations of health care and has been recognized as a valid and reliable instrument for this purpose.

The instrument is most useful for identifying how a participant is functioning at the present time and for identifying improvement or deterioration over time. There are 8 domains of function measured with the Lawton IADL scale (telephone use, shopping, cooking, housekeeping, laundry, mode of transportation, responsibility of own medications, and ability to handle finances). Participants are scored according to their level of functioning from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent). Higher score for each domain represents better functional performance of the older people.",

During the treatment, patients will either simultaneously receive a GnRH analogue or undergo a bilateral orchiectomy prior to treatment to maintain a castrate level of testosterone ( 50 ng/dl). At progression, patients will undergo a second biopsy of the same metastatic lesion of the baseline biopsy.
