        "BriefSummary": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. Sickle-shaped cells can cause problems by getting stuck in blood vessels, blocking blood flow, and can cause inflammation and injury to important body parts. There are no specific treatments that improve this condition and promote blood flow hindered by sickle cell blockages. Another big challenge in managing sickle cell disease is that there are no good measures to determine changes and improvements in blood flow.\n\nContrast-enhanced ultrasound is a technique currently used to detect blood flow in the heart, muscles, and other organs. It is extremely sensitive and can detect blood flow in the smallest of blood vessels. It would be very useful in helping healthcare providers know whether treatment strategies are improving blood flow during sickle cell blockages.\n\nThe hypothesis is that contrast-enhanced ultrasound will be a feasible tool for determining changes in blood flow of subjects with sickle cell disease.",

        "BriefSummary": "Hypothesis\n\nEfficient unloading of oxygen to regions of high metabolic demand requires a healthy microvasculature to sense local oxygen tension and regulate flow, accordingly. In sickle cell disease patients, the investigators have demonstrated oxygen supply-demand mismatch, or SDM, in proportion to anemia severity. SDM occurs in both the peripheral circulation and the brain, and four characteristics: 1) Hyperemia beyond expected for the level of anemia, 2) Corresponding loss of vascular dilatory reserve, 3) Impaired oxygen unloading to the tissues, and 4) Tissue hypoxia. In sickle cell disease, red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) adhere to vascular endothelium triggering transient or irreversible microvascular damage as well as releasing vasoactive substances that contribute to microvascular dysregulation. The investigators postulate that ongoing microvascular damage/dysregulation in the setting of increased total blood flow contributes to SDM. The investigators believe SEG101, by lowering RBC and WBC adhesion to the microvasculature, will improve SDM and tissue oxygenation.\n\nObjectives\n\nPrimary - The investigators will test whether SEG101 improves SDM in patients with sickle cell anemia by measuring the change in tissue oxygenation measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).\nSecondary/Exploratory - The investigators will identify end-organ disease and whether improvement of SDM by SEG101 occurs in patients with sickle cell anemia.",

In the investigators' country, this disease affects about 3,000 children each year and is considered one of the most prevalent disorders among the group of existing hereditary diseases.\n\nThe lungs are frequently affected in this disease by Acute Chest Syndrome (STA). Besides being the leading cause of death and the second leading cause of hospitalization in SCA, the STA is correlated with cognitive impairment frame these patients, resulting secondary Stroke vaso-occlusion of capillaries that supply the brain tissue.\n\nTraditional tests of pulmonary function allow assess whether the person has any commitment in the respiratory system, whether obstructive, restrictive or mixed. To run these tests it is necessary that the patient understands and performs a forced expiratory maneuver to obtain reliable results. In the particular case of SCA, performing these tests it is very difficult due to the presence of cognitive impairment of varying degrees. This results in underdiagnosis of early changes in the lung parenchyma during the therapeutic window, committing the proper monitoring and treatment offered to these patients.",

        "BriefSummary": "Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a common hereditary haemoglobin disorder in Africa. World wide it is estimated that about 300,000 newborns are born every year. Of which 75% of them live in Sub-saharan Africa (SSA). In Uganda, about 15,000 babies are born with sickle cell disease per year.\n\nIn Uganda, the stroke prevalence was found to be 6.2% in children admitted to the National referral hospital in Kampala. Notable between 21 to 30% of these children presented with co-morbidities such as anaemia, bacteraemia and painfull crisis. Stroke in SCA is mediated by several mechanism such as cellular adhesions, inflammatory markers, hemolysis associated oxidative stress and hemostatic activation. Stroke in SCA is primarily a large vessel stroke and the mechanisim state above lead to a narrowing of the lumen of the cerebral arteries Arterial ischaemic stroke which occurs frequently in children with SCA has been associated with bacterial infections. Recent studies have shown that minor infections such as flu like infections can play a critical role in the trigger of stroke in children.\n\nOur hypothesis is that viral flu infections is a key trigger for the risk of stroke in children with SCA. Our objective is to prevent the occurrence of flu illnesses in children with SCA thereby reducing the risk for stroke in our population of children with SCA.\n\nMethods: A randomized controlled double blinded study Study site: The study will be conducted at the Sickle Cell Clinic (SCC), Mulago Hospital. Inclusion criteria: will be ;age between 2 years and 12 years;All children whose parents will have consented and those above 7years will have to assent. Exclusion criteria: all children with previous strokes; children who have acute illness and are not clinically stable; any child with previous documented adverse event following immunization (AEFI).\n\nSample Size: Using Open EPI calculator for cohort studies we calculated a total sample size of 136 participant to achieve our objective. Using a 95% confidence interval, power of 80% and an unexposed outcome of 25% (4) using a ratio of 1:1. Each arm will have 68 participants. With anticipated 10% loss to follow up a total sample size of 150 with each arm having 75 participants.\n\nStudy utility: Globally, stroke triggers have been recently identified independent of the existing risk factors such as high cerebral velocity speeds on TCDs. Flues like illnesses have been reported to be stroke triggers in children with arterial ischaemic strokes worldwide.This study may influence the role of influenza vaccination in the prevention of stroke triggers in children with sickle cell anaemia. It will also add to the existing modalities which have helped to reduce the incidence of stroke amongst this high risk group of children with",

It also means that the FDA has not yet approved the drug for your type of disease.\n\nSCD is an inherited blood disorder that causes the red blood cells to change their shape from a round shape to a half-moon/crescent or sickled shape. People who have SCD have a different type of protein that carries oxygen in their blood (hemoglobin) than people without SCD. This different type of hemoglobin makes the red blood cells change into crescent shape under certain conditions. Sickle-shaped cells are a problem because they often get stuck in the blood vessels blocking the flow of blood, and cause inflammation and injury to important areas in the body.\n\nRegadenoson (trade name Lexiscan) is a drug that may prevent this inflammation and injury caused by the sickle shaped cells. This drug is approved by the FDA to be used as a fast infusion during a heart stress test in people who are unable to exercise enough to put stress on their heart by making the heart beat faster. Regadenoson has been studied as a long infusion at this dose in adults, and no safety issues have been identified (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01085201). This is the first study to look at patient benefit with the long infusion of the drug. This drug has been used in laboratory experiments and information from those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to protect the body from damage caused by sickle-shaped cells in this research study.\n\nIn this research study, the investigators are specifically looking to see if Regadenoson is an effective treatment for pain crises and acute chest syndrome in SCD.",

We sought to investigate the occurrence of exercise-induced PH in patients with SCA and normal pulmonary pressure (PP) at rest, and its relationship with clinical and echocardiographic variables.Forty-four patients with SCA and normal PP at rest were studied and divided into two groups: exhibiting normal PP after treadmill EE (TRVâ‰¤2.7m/s) (G1), and exhibiting exercise-induced PH (TRV>2.7m/s) (G2). TRV cutoff points at rest and during exercise were based on data from healthy control subjects, matched for age, sex, and body surface area. Data obtained from EE were correlated with clinical, echocardiographic and ergometric variables.Exercise-induced PH occurred in 57% of the sample (G2), significantly higher than those of G1. Exercise-induced PH was related to higher levels of creatinine (p<0.05), increased left atrial volume (p<0.05) and right ventricular diastolic area (p<0.05), larger E/Em waves ratio derived from spectral and tissue Doppler (p<0.05), and higher TRV at rest (p<0.005).We concluded that patients with SCA and normal PP at rest may exhibit exercise-induced PH, which was related to renal function, increased cardiac chambers, abnormal indices of diastolic function and baseline TRV levels.",
