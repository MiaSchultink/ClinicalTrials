The final version of the DMD-GAS that was agreed upon the experts consisted of 10 items, and each item scored between 0 and 2. The intra-rater reliability was established by the video analysis of children with a 1-month interval and inter-rater reliability was determined by the scores of 3 physiotherapists. The criterion validity was determined by investigating the relationship between the total score of the DMD-GAS and Motor Function Measure (MFM), 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and the data obtained from GAITRite system.",Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Gait Assessment Scale (DMD-GAS),None (Open Label),18 Years,0,undefined,undefined

The protocol was applied during the evaluation that was carried out at outpatient follow-up visits.

To assess the functionality of each patient, the Vignos scales were used to characterize the sample and the Motor Function Measure (MFM) for association with HRV indices.

All heart rate records were performed using a cardiofrequencymeter (V800, Polar).

It holds promise for children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle disuse atrophy. Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to fear of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without assistance). Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for delaying complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as maintaining bone health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The primary outcome will be to document safety and feasibility of WBVT in this patient population. The secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in muscle strength and endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of routine clinical care. The study will include 20 ambulatory boys with DMD; patients will be randomized (1:1 allocation) into 2 groups: WBVT treatment or no WBVT treatment (controls).
