It shows X-linked recessive inheritance. It is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the dystrophin protein localized in Xp21.2. It is characterized by complete or partial deficiency of the cell membrane protein called dystrophin. Deficiency of dystrophin causes disruption of the structure of the muscle sarcolemma. Accordingly, the stress caused by repetitive contractions damages the sarcolemma. This deficiency leads to continuous degeneration of muscle fibers. As a result, it causes progressive loss in the strength of skeletal muscles, respiration and later cardiac muscles. As the disease progresses, due to muscle damage and weakness, the child's ability to perform daily tasks such as climbing stairs and walking short distances becomes impaired and functional skills decrease. Respiratory and cardiac muscle involvement is the most important cause of mortality in these patients before the age of 30.\n\nParticipation is a measurable outcome of health. This measure is defined as direct participation in life by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Participation for children and youth includes activities such as personal care, mobility, social relations, education, play and leisure activities. Disabled children participate less in daily activities than healthy children.\n\nConsidering the progression of their diseases, the participation of children with DMD in physical activity decreases over time. Functional disorders in children with DMD affect their daily living activities, limiting their participation in similar activities with their peers. Research shows that children with DMD have lower levels of physical activity from a young age than their healthy peers. There are also studies in the literature showing that there is a decrease in the functional independence and quality of life of children with DMD as well as their families and caregivers.\n\nParticipation in regular physical activity in disabled children and youth contributes to physical, psychosocial and social development. Safe and effective physical activity can positively affect the nutritional status, mobility and social participation of patients with DMD throughout their lives. This indicates that we need to improve our understanding of the determinants and mechanisms underlying the thinking of children and adolescents with DMD regarding physical activity behaviors.\n\nParents play an important role in shaping their children's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors across a wide range of developmental domains, including cognitive, social, and emotional domains. In addition to studies examining physical activity interventions for healthy children and youth, strong evidence has been shown that families can have a significant influence in increasing the physical activity of children and youth with disabilities. Parental behaviors that promote physical activity in children have two aspects: 1) role modeling, which includes efforts to be active alongside the parent's interest in physical activity, and 2) parental encouragement and involvement, providing access and opportunities for the child to be active (for example transport to sports complexes and parks). Studies examining the influence of parents on physical activity behaviors of children and adolescents shows that there is a positive relationship between parental behaviors and the activities in which children participate.\n\nWhen the literature on individuals with DMD was examined, a limited number of studies were found that investigated both the physical activity level of the child with DMD and the effects of the parent on the activity level of the child with DMD. Therefore, the aims of our study are to determine the physical activity levels of school-age children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy who can walk and to investigate the effect of the family on the child's physical activity level and participation.","enrollment":30,"isFDAreg":false,"url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05209087","__v":1,"city":"Ankara","country":"Turkey","location":"62bd38c9158338846d0a2855","studyFacility":"Hacettepe University","gender":"Male","maxAge":18,"minAge":8,"participants":"62bd3e19158338846d0a35f5","compDate":"2022-11-29T20:00:00.000Z","compDay":0,"compMonth":"June","compYear":2022,"startDate":"2020-10-31T20:00:00.000Z","startDay":1,"startMonth":"March","startYear":2020,"status":"Recruiting","results":"62bd8cdc1d9694c9e5f9fcfd","hasResults":false,"dateRetultsPosted":"May 17, 2021","allocation":"","interventionModel":"","method":"62bda63317275cf888b34948","outcomeMeasureDescription":"","secondaryOutcomeMeasure":"","strCDate":"\"June 2022\"","strSDate":"March 1, 2020\""},{"_id":"62bd3764158338846d0a2269","rank":42,"NCTID":"NCT03534349","phase":[""],"officialTitle":"Lower Limb Flexibility in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Effects on Functional Performance","briefSumarry":"The investigator investigated the effect of lower limb flexibility on functional performance of children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.","detailedDescription":"Thirty children whose functional levels were in 1 or 2 according to the Brooke Lower Extremity Functional Classification Scale were included in the study.

DMD is an X linked recessive disorder. DMD is characterized by complete or partial (<3%) deficiency of the cell membrane protein dystrophin.\n\nDystrophin deficiency results in a permanent deterioration of muscle fibers. This leads to a progressive decrease in muscle strength and functional abilities. The precise mechanism of how the defect of dystrophin leads to degeneration of muscle fibers remains uncertain, but cytoskeletal deterioration, sarcolemmal instability and abnormal calcium homeostasis are thought to play a role in this degeneration.\n\nThese patients have symptoms such as limb proximals and progressive muscle weakness in the trunk, gait abnormalities, Gower's sign, various degrees of restriction in daily living activities, and frequent falls. The majority of patients have elevated serum creatine kinase or elevated liver transaminases and less frequently language or general developmental retardation.\n\nWalking ability of this children begins to deteriorate between the ages of 3-6. These patients are generally dependent on wheelchair aged 10-12 years. The loss of walking is the milestone in terms of the progression of the disease. The use of electric wheelchairs limits arm functions such as lengthening and lifting during the late phase of the illness (when the ambulance has been lost and the ambulance is being continued with the wheelchair).\n\nPatients with DMD have an average life span of 30 years with spinal surgery and ventilation support. They spend most of their lives dependent on the wheelchair and need functional use of the upper limbs to maintain the best possible level of independence in their daily life activities throughout their lifetimes.\n\nAlthough muscle weakness in the proximal limbs is the first finding of the disease, the influence of upper extremity functions gives symptoms after 8 years of age and has a great influence on the level of independence of DMD patients in life since this process. For this reason, rehabilitation approaches for the protection of upper extremity functions from the early period of the disease are of great importance.Effective interventions are necessary to achieve this goal and these variables must be considered when making clinical decisions.\n\nPatients with adult DMD have been shown to be able to perform important functional activities with limited distal motor function in the late phase of disease, but tend to lose these capacities as muscle strength decreases. For this reason, determining the factors (grip strength, thumb opposition, upper extremity joint range of motion, upper extremity muscle strength, etc.) that may affect hand functions, which is an important component in maintaining upper extremity functioning, and how these factors are related to the general functions of the upper extremity it is crucial that this disease leads to physiotherapy rehabilitation programs to be implemented.","enrollment":23,"isFDAreg":false,"url":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03521271","__v":1,"city":"Ankara","country":"Turkey","location":"62bd38c9158338846d0a2855","studyFacility":"Hacettepe University","gender":"Male","maxAge":16,"minAge":8,"participants":"62bd3e55158338846d0a36b1","compDate":"2018-12-25T20:00:00.000Z","compDay":26,"compMonth":"January","compYear":2018,"startDate":"2017-11-04T20:00:00.000Z","startDay":5,"startMonth":"April","startYear":2017,"status":"Completed","hasResults":false,"results":"62bd8d4b1d9694c9e5f9fdbd","allocation":"","interventionModel":"","method":"62bda65a17275cf888b34a08","outcomeMeasureDescription":"","secondaryOutcomeMeasure":"Quality of life assessment of children (0-100)","strCDate":"\"January 26, 2018\"","strSDate":"April 5, 2017\""},{"_id":"62bd376b158338846d0a2285","rank":56,"NCTID":"NCT04287582","phase":[""],"officialTitle":"The Evaluation of Muscle Activation in Climbing up Stairs Activity in Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy","briefSumarry":"Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have difficulties towards the end of the ambulatory period, especially in activities that require lower extremity proximal muscle strength such as walking, climbing stairs, standing up without sitting.
