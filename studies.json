The recruitment of groups was carried out at the neuromuscular disease outpatient clinic of the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The recruited individuals were divided into 4 groups, namely: DMD that used deflazacort (DMD-D) with n=11; DMD that used Prednisone/Prednisolone (DMD-P), with n=9; DMD Control with no corticoid use (DMD-C), and n=10 and Controls with typical development (CTD) with n=10. The protocol was applied during the evaluation that was carried out at outpatient follow-up visits. Anthropometry was analyzed in 4 groups and functionality was assessed in 3 groups with DMD. To assess the functionality of each patient, the Vignos scales were used to characterize the sample and the Motor Function Measure (MFM) for association with HRV indices.\n\nInitially, the resting ECG was analyzed to verify the existence of sinus rhythm and to exclude individuals with arrhythmias and blocks. The measurements at rest were performed immediately before and after the HRV assessment, including systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP), heart rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RF - blood pressure) to ensure that at the beginning and at the end of the collection FR remains between 9 - 24rpm, in the range of 0.15 - 0.40Hz) and partial oxygen saturation (SO2). Heart rate was recorded by the cardiofrequency meter (RS800CX, Polar). And the partial oxygen saturation by means of a digital oximeter (DX2010, Dixtal) connected to the participant's index finger or hallux, through a sensor of age-appropriate size, in room air. Hemoglobin saturation by oxygen was recorded after the first minute of stabilization, as the value that remains most constant during the second minute.\n\nAll heart rate records were performed using a cardiofrequencymeter (V800, Polar). After placing the brace and monitor, the individuals were placed in the supine position and remained at rest spontaneously breathing for 25 minutes. For HRV analysis, indexes obtained by linear methods, in the domain of time and frequency, and non-linear methods were used.\n\nIn the time domain, for linear analyses, each normal RR interval (sinus beats) was verified during a certain time interval and, using statistical and non-linear methods, the translating indexes of fluctuations in the duration of the cardiac cycles were calculated. With this, the indices expressed in ms were obtained: SDNN (Standard deviation of the normal RR intervals recorded in a time interval); rMSSD (square root of the mean of the square of the differences between adjacent normal RR intervals in a time interval).\n\nIn the frequency domain, the spectral power density is more used, mainly when treating individuals in resting conditions. This analysis divides HRV into fundamental oscillatory components, which were used the main: High Frequency normalized unite (HFnu) component and Low Frequency normalized unite (LFnu) component. O algoritmo utilizado para a análise espectral foi a transformada rápida de Fourier - FFT (janela de 256 s com 50% de overlap).\n\nAmong the nonlinear methods used for HRV analysis, we can mention the Detrended Fluctuations Analysis (DFA), Visual Recurrence Analysis (VRA) and symbolic analysis (SA), the three of which were verified in this study.\n\nDFA is used to quantify the fractal property of RR interval time series, being used to detect possible abnormalities present in a subject, based on α coefficients. For this, short memory parameters α1, which corresponds to a period of 4 to 11 beats, and long memory α2, which corresponds to the period from 64 to 1024 beats, were used.\n\nThe VRA is used to study the time dependence of a series, that is, in the study of stationarity35. The recurrence graph makes it possible to visualize the behavior of trajectories in the phase space and, in addition, to show the times in which a state of a dynamic system is repeated, besides these factors can be confirmed regarding the quantitative analysis of this, wich presents such indices: Mean, SD, PerRec, PerDet, PerLam, TrapTim, Ratio.\n\nThe evaluation of the symbolic analysis is based on the quantification of the information carried in a time series, in the transformation of the previously selected iRRs into integers from zero to six, from which sequences of 3 symbols (symbolic patterns) are constructed. For this, all possible patterns will be grouped according to the number and type of variations between the symbols, shown subsequently. The patterns were (1) patterns, without variation (0V), three identical symbols; (2) patterns with a variation (1V), that is, two subsequent symbols that are the same and a different one; (3) patterns with two similar variations (2LV) that is, the three symbols form a ramp; (4) patterns with two different variations (2ULV), that is, the three symbols form a peak or a valley."],"EnrollmentCount":["40"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":2,"NCTId":["NCT05244395"],"OfficialTitle":["Development of a New Instrument to Evaluate Gait Characteristics of Individuals With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Gait Assessment Scale for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, and Its Validity and Reliability"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["The aim of this study was to develop a gait assessment instrument for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients (DMD-GAS), and investigate its validity and reliability.The scale was developed considering the expert opinions which included 10 physiotherapists who had experience in the management of patients with DMD over the 2-round Delphi method, and the Content Validity Index (CVI) was calculated.

It shows X-linked recessive inheritance. It is caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the dystrophin protein localized in Xp21.2. It is characterized by complete or partial deficiency of the cell membrane protein called dystrophin. Deficiency of dystrophin causes disruption of the structure of the muscle sarcolemma. Accordingly, the stress caused by repetitive contractions damages the sarcolemma. This deficiency leads to continuous degeneration of muscle fibers. As a result, it causes progressive loss in the strength of skeletal muscles, respiration and later cardiac muscles. As the disease progresses, due to muscle damage and weakness, the child's ability to perform daily tasks such as climbing stairs and walking short distances becomes impaired and functional skills decrease. Respiratory and cardiac muscle involvement is the most important cause of mortality in these patients before the age of 30.\n\nParticipation is a measurable outcome of health. This measure is defined as direct participation in life by the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Participation for children and youth includes activities such as personal care, mobility, social relations, education, play and leisure activities. Disabled children participate less in daily activities than healthy children.\n\nConsidering the progression of their diseases, the participation of children with DMD in physical activity decreases over time. Functional disorders in children with DMD affect their daily living activities, limiting their participation in similar activities with their peers. Research shows that children with DMD have lower levels of physical activity from a young age than their healthy peers. There are also studies in the literature showing that there is a decrease in the functional independence and quality of life of children with DMD as well as their families and caregivers.\n\nParticipation in regular physical activity in disabled children and youth contributes to physical, psychosocial and social development. Safe and effective physical activity can positively affect the nutritional status, mobility and social participation of patients with DMD throughout their lives. This indicates that we need to improve our understanding of the determinants and mechanisms underlying the thinking of children and adolescents with DMD regarding physical activity behaviors.\n\nParents play an important role in shaping their children's beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors across a wide range of developmental domains, including cognitive, social, and emotional domains. In addition to studies examining physical activity interventions for healthy children and youth, strong evidence has been shown that families can have a significant influence in increasing the physical activity of children and youth with disabilities. Parental behaviors that promote physical activity in children have two aspects: 1) role modeling, which includes efforts to be active alongside the parent's interest in physical activity, and 2) parental encouragement and involvement, providing access and opportunities for the child to be active (for example transport to sports complexes and parks). Studies examining the influence of parents on physical activity behaviors of children and adolescents shows that there is a positive relationship between parental behaviors and the activities in which children participate.\n\nWhen the literature on individuals with DMD was examined, a limited number of studies were found that investigated both the physical activity level of the child with DMD and the effects of the parent on the activity level of the child with DMD. Therefore, the aims of our study are to determine the physical activity levels of school-age children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy who can walk and to investigate the effect of the family on the child's physical activity level and participation."],"EnrollmentCount":["30"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":8,"NCTId":["NCT02069756"],"OfficialTitle":["The Duchenne Registry: An International, Patient-Report Registry for Individuals With Duchenne and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (Member of TREAT-NMD Neuromuscular Network)"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["The Duchenne Registry is an online, patient-report registry for individuals with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy and carrier females.

This is due, in part, to the increased ability of families, parents, individuals with rare disorders, and advocacy organizations to access and control information, to provide monetary or other incentives, and to communicate directly with biopharmaceutical companies and clinical investigators. Increasingly, advocacy organizations (and by extension, the families they serve) create or participate in disorder registries intended to facilitate research by industry and access of families to clinical trials; fund promising bench and clinical research; and lobby for outcomes beneficial to drug developers and researchers, such as increased funding or facilitated FDA approval. The involvement of families in the research process is likely to have implications for how willing individuals are to participate in studies, their expectations and perceptions of the study experience, and their behavior during the study. Their increased level of involvement may also affect how families perceive and respond to a clinical trial in which the results are not as promising as hoped, as quickly as hoped. This partnership approach has implications for biopharmaceutical companies who sponsor treatment trials and for clinical investigators who lead and implement the trials. This qualitative interview study aims to describe, from the perspectives of parents of children involved in a clinical trial, research clinicians implementing the trial, and the company sponsoring the trial, the experience of this new, more collaborative research process.

It holds promise for children with neuromuscular disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since muscle weakness results not only from muscle breakdown but also physical inactivity and muscle disuse atrophy. Weak DMD patients may increasingly limit their physical activity due to fear of falling or loss of independence (e.g. difficulty rising to stand without assistance). Prolonging the length of time boys with DMD are ambulatory is important for delaying complications of this disease (lung hypoventilation, scoliosis) as well as maintaining bone health. We propose to conduct a pilot study of WBVT in young boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The primary outcome will be to document safety and feasibility of WBVT in this patient population. The secondary outcomes will evaluate changes in muscle strength and endurance. Bone health will also be examined as part of routine clinical care.

Treatment with corticosteroids is standard of care for patients with DMD five years old and older, due to the robust observation that this intervention lengthens the interval prior to loss of ambulation but is associated with many side effects. This clinical trial will be conducted in the youngest age group able to receive corticosteroids orally and on whom study outcomes are measurable, ages 3 to 7 years. This is a randomized, double blinded, double masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial that will explore whether better synchronization of corticosteroid administration with the circadian rhythm will provide improved tolerability and at least comparable efficacy to current standards in which corticosteroids are always given in the morning.

DMD causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass, with symptoms usually appearing in early childhood. DMD arises from mutations in the DMD gene that codes for dystrophin.\n\nThe DMD gene is located on the short arm of chromosome X (locus Xp21) and codes for dystrophin, containing 3685 amino acid residues. 60-65% of DMD mutations are large dele-tions, 10-30% are nonsense and frame-shift mutations, 5-15% are duplications, and 2% are intronic or 5'- and 3'-UTR alterations.Dystrophin aggregates as a homotetramer in the skeletal muscles or associates with actin and Dystrophin-Associated Glycoproteins (DAGs), forming a stable complex that interacts with laminin in the extracellular matrix. Dystrophin is considered a key structural element in the muscle fiber, whose primary function is to stabilize plasma mem-brane, while the DAGs maintain the sarcolemmal stability by mediating the complex interactions of the muscle membrane and extracellular environment. The low levels of dystrophin lead to cellular instability and progressive leakage of intracellular components, explaining the characteristically high levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in the blood of DMD patients.\n\nBiomarkers serve as measurable indicators of normal biological or pathological processes.

The rectus femoris (RF), cranial sartorius (CS), gastrocnemius (GAST), and lateral deltoid (DT) muscles will be targeted for their known phenotypic variation in response to dystrophin deficiency. The RF undergoes early necrosis and fatty deposition, the CS is thought to be relatively spared, and the GAST seems to undergo true hypertrophy. The DT, which undergoes hypertrophy like the GAST, will also be examined to determine if the impact of dystrophin deficiency varies between upper and lower limbs.

The 10 boys in the 5-9 aged cohort will likely not lose ambulation during the study. Because the primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the potential of DP ARF imaging as a relevant surrogate for monitoring disease progression and response to therapies, the focus of the study will be on correlating DP ARF results to change in functional degeneration and time to loss of ambulation.\n\nThere are two experimental components to this study beyond what is standard practice for DMD patients: 1) DP ARF ultrasound imaging of the rectus femoris (RF), cranial sartorius (CS), gastrocnemius (GAST), and lateral deltoid (DT) muscles and 2) standard quantitative muscle testing (QMT) and timed function tests (TFTs) of time to standing, 6-minute walk, and 30-feet walk repeated every four months (three times annually) throughout the four-year duration of the study.\n\nThis study will commence with DP ARF ultrasound imaging in the Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory during the patient volunteer's first regularly scheduled research visit. Patient volunteers are expected to be outpatients. However, if a patient volunteer is an inpatient, DP ARF ultrasound imaging may be performed at the patient volunteer's hospital bedside. Immediately following DP ARF examination, the patient volunteer will undergo QMT and TFTs in the Physical Therapy Department. QMT and TFT will be conducted by trained physical therapists. DP ARF ultrasound imaging, QMT and TFT will be repeated as described above at each of the patient volunteers' twelve regularly scheduled research visits over the four-year study duration. Whenever possible, we will schedule research visits to coincide with other clinical visits to UNC.

Imaging will be performed as described for the boys with DMD. The DP ARF results obtained in boys with no known neuromuscular disorders will be compared to those obtained in boys with neuromuscular disorders to serve as a control for changes in muscle mechanical property to occur with normal muscle growth and development.\n\nDP ARF ultrasound is a noninvasive diagnostic imaging technology performed using commercially available clinical ultrasound imaging equipment - the Siemens Acuson Antares imaging system equipped for research purposes and VF10-5 or VF7-3 linear array transducers (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA Inc.

Patient volunteers will be asked to lie on an examination table in the Clinical Neurophysiology Clinic (outpatients) or to remain in their hospital beds (inpatients). The head of the exam table/bed may be raised to an approximate 45 degree angle to best visualize the muscles of interest with ultrasound imaging.\n\nOnce the patient volunteer is positioned, ultrasound gel will be applied to the patient volunteer's skin surface above the muscles of interest. The ultrasound imaging transducer will then be placed on top of the gel. Once the first muscle of interest is located, DP ARF ultrasound imaging will begin. We will orient the transducer to acquire ultrasound data transverse to the muscle fibers in the middle of the muscle length-wise, with three repeated acquisitions. We will then rotate our transducer 90 degrees to orient the imaging plane parallel to the muscle fibers. The previously imaged cross-section will be positioned in the approximate middle of the imaging field of view, with three repeated acquisitions. Muscle fiber orientation will be approximate, as surmised from anatomy. The DP ARF axial focal depth will be directed to the center of the muscle, approximately 20 - 30 mm.\n\nThe length of time for DP ARF data collection in each muscle is estimated to be less than 10 minutes. Once DP ARF imaging is completed on one muscle, DP ARF imaging will be performed on the other muscles of interest. Once all 4 muscles (RF, CS, GAST and DT) are imaged, the study procedure will be completed for the DP ARF imaging portion of the study.\n\nFor the second part of the study, beginning shortly (less than 4 hours) after DP ARF imaging is completed, the patient volunteer will undergo clinically standard quantitative muscle testing (QMT) of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) in the right RF, CS, GAST and DT. The patient volunteer will also undergo clinically standard timed function tests (TFTs) of (1) time to rise from supine to standing, (2) distance walked in six minutes and (3) time to walk 30 feet.\n\nPatient volunteers' participation will end once both study parts one (DP ARF ultrasound imaging) and two (QMT and TFT) are completed twelve times over 4 years. Therefore, there will be regularly scheduled follow-up visits required of the patient volunteers every four months. The patient volunteer is asked to assent and his parents are asked to permit their son to undergo (1) DP ARF ultrasound imaging of his right RF, CS, GAST and DT muscles, and (2) QMT and TFTs of time to standing, 6-minute walk, and 30-feet walk.

In general DMD is caused by mutations that disrupt the reading frame thus leading to a failure to express dystrophin.\n\nRecent scientific research has led to the belief that DMD may be treated by correcting the genetic error in the dystrophin gene which causes DMD.

Up to an additional 3 subjects may be enrolled in cohorts 1 or 2, should cohort 3 not be enrolled.\n\nScreening\n\nA physical examination, including body weight, height, arm span, neuromuscular examination and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and temperature).\nNeuropsychiatric assessment of both subject and the family.\nMolecular genetic on blood sample and dystrophin analysis of original muscle biopsy obtained at diagnosis.\nMuscle MRI scans of lower limbs to assess the preservation of the muscle to be targeted with the injection of AON.\nBiochemical (blood) and urine investigation to include standard biochemistry and haematology (full blood count; coagulation screen; liver function test; serum Ig; protein electrophoresis; inflammatory markers; creatinine kinase; gamma glutamyl transferase; urine biochemistry).\nCardiovascular assessments: ECG and heart echocardiogram.\nPulmonary assessments: Forced vital capacity, overnight oxygen saturation monitoring.\nSkin biopsy for MyoD-transfection.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe muscle to be used is the extensor digitorum brevis, a foot muscle with very little function in children with mobility difficulties.\nLocal injection will be performed directly through the skin using a combined EMG-delivery needle. While the procedure could be performed under local anaesthetic; where possible, it will be performed under general anaesthetic in order to reduce distress to the subject. A skin tattoo featuring a 1 cm x 1 cm grid with 2 lines in between to divide it in 9 smaller squares will be used to mark the site of the injection precisely and for a subsequent muscle biopsy.\nThe total volume of each injection will be 100 μL containing the AVI-4658. Nine injections will be performed at 3 mm intervals inside the 1 cm2 grid tattoo. The depth of the injection will be carefully recorded.\n\nObservation\n\nPatients will be closely monitored within the clinical research facility by designated nursing staff educated in the trial protocol and with experience in similar Phase I/II studies.\nThe clinical research facility has close access to intensive care unit facilities in the event of an unforeseen adverse reaction.\n\nFollow-up Day 2 - Patients will be discharged. Prior to discharge, a brief physical examination and systems review will be performed.\n\nDay 3 - A further brief physical examination and systems review including examination of the injection sites and reporting of any reactions. This examination can be performed at the local surgery or at the hospital of the referring clinician.\n\nDays 5, 7 - Contact with the subject and inquire as to current status.\n\nDay 14 to 28 - The subject is admitted to hospital. Perform systems assessment (physical examination), body weight and vital signs. Blood and urine biochemistry will be repeated then as well as open biopsies of both injected muscles will be performed under general or local anaesthetic.\n\nDay 30 - Contact with the subject and inquiry as to current status.\n\nDay 60 - Contact the subject and inquiry as to current status.\n\nDay 120 - (Final Visit at the hospital where the study drug was administered).

In addition, an interface that required physical contact -Touch Screen - a sensitive monitor to touch the computer screen itself. The use of interfaces with and without physical contact are interesting to identify the functionality of the devices.\n\nTherefore, the game presented 126 bubbles arranged in rows and columns . The goal was that the participant could achieve (changing color) the largest number of bubbles during 10 seconds, thereby defining a range zone for the specified time.\n\nAfter defining the scope zone, the therapist established a red target bubble, which was chosen in the center of bottom of range line. The participant should play this target bubble using one of the devices, Touch Screen, Kinect and Leap Motion. After touch of target bubble, the game had another red bubble in a random position, within range of area. After reaching the random bubble, the bubble target was displayed again, and so on. The game features red bubbles within the range area, and sometimes out of range, thus creating a higher degree of difficulty and to encourage participants to challenge their limits.\n\nThe Participants were divided into groups which performed the tasks with different interaction devices, more virtual feature (not touch the computer using Kinect or leap motion) or real (to touch the computer screen)."],"EnrollmentCount":["120"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Supportive Care"]},{"Rank":52,"NCTId":["NCT01957059"],"OfficialTitle":["A Phase I/II, Open-label, Dose Escalating With 48 Week Treatment Study to Assess the Safety and Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics and Efficacy of BMN053 (Previously Known as PRO053) in Subjects With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy."],"OverallStatus":["Terminated"],"Phase":["Phase 1","Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["The purpose of the study is to see whether BMN053 is safe and effective to use as medication for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with a mutation around location 53 in the DNA for the dystrophin protein."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["June 2013"],"CompletionDate":["August 3, 2016"],"DetailedDescription":["A Phase I/II, open-label, dose escalating with 48-week treatment study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of BMN 053 (previously known as PRO053) in subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy"],"EnrollmentCount":["9"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":53,"NCTId":["NCT01359670"],"OfficialTitle":["Functional Muscle Ischemia and PDE5A Inhibition in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Early Phase 1"],"BriefSummary":["This study, supported by Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy, will determine if tadalafil or sildenafil can improve muscle blood flow during exercise in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy."],"CollaboratorName":["Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy"],"StartDate":["May 2011"],"CompletionDate":["May 2013"],"DetailedDescription":["Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, progressive and fatal muscle disease affecting boys and accounts for 80% of muscular dystrophy cases.

The purpose of this study is to 1) determine if tadalafil or sildenafil can improve muscle blood flow during exercise in boys with DMD; and 2) to inform the design of a subsequent, randomized, multi-center trial with clinical endpoints.\n\nThe investigators will enroll boys with DMD between the ages of 7 and 15 years who are ambulatory and without clinical heart failure.

DMD is an X linked recessive disorder. DMD is characterized by complete or partial (<3%) deficiency of the cell membrane protein dystrophin.\n\nDystrophin deficiency results in a permanent deterioration of muscle fibers. This leads to a progressive decrease in muscle strength and functional abilities. The precise mechanism of how the defect of dystrophin leads to degeneration of muscle fibers remains uncertain, but cytoskeletal deterioration, sarcolemmal instability and abnormal calcium homeostasis are thought to play a role in this degeneration.\n\nThese patients have symptoms such as limb proximals and progressive muscle weakness in the trunk, gait abnormalities, Gower's sign, various degrees of restriction in daily living activities, and frequent falls. The majority of patients have elevated serum creatine kinase or elevated liver transaminases and less frequently language or general developmental retardation.\n\nWalking ability of this children begins to deteriorate between the ages of 3-6. These patients are generally dependent on wheelchair aged 10-12 years. The loss of walking is the milestone in terms of the progression of the disease. The use of electric wheelchairs limits arm functions such as lengthening and lifting during the late phase of the illness (when the ambulance has been lost and the ambulance is being continued with the wheelchair).\n\nPatients with DMD have an average life span of 30 years with spinal surgery and ventilation support. They spend most of their lives dependent on the wheelchair and need functional use of the upper limbs to maintain the best possible level of independence in their daily life activities throughout their lifetimes.\n\nAlthough muscle weakness in the proximal limbs is the first finding of the disease, the influence of upper extremity functions gives symptoms after 8 years of age and has a great influence on the level of independence of DMD patients in life since this process. For this reason, rehabilitation approaches for the protection of upper extremity functions from the early period of the disease are of great importance.Effective interventions are necessary to achieve this goal and these variables must be considered when making clinical decisions.\n\nPatients with adult DMD have been shown to be able to perform important functional activities with limited distal motor function in the late phase of disease, but tend to lose these capacities as muscle strength decreases. For this reason, determining the factors (grip strength, thumb opposition, upper extremity joint range of motion, upper extremity muscle strength, etc.) that may affect hand functions, which is an important component in maintaining upper extremity functioning, and how these factors are related to the general functions of the upper extremity it is crucial that this disease leads to physiotherapy rehabilitation programs to be implemented."],"EnrollmentCount":["23"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":56,"NCTId":["NCT04287582"],"OfficialTitle":["The Evaluation of Muscle Activation in Climbing up Stairs Activity in Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"],"OverallStatus":["Unknown status"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have difficulties towards the end of the ambulatory period, especially in activities that require lower extremity proximal muscle strength such as walking, climbing stairs, standing up without sitting.

Over the last 40 years parents have received little guidance on the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy to maintain muscle function.

Recent research in rodent models and milder forms of muscular dystrophy supports earlier studies that resistance exercise may have beneficial effects for maintenance of muscle mass in dystrophic muscle. However, careful and systematic investigation into the safety and feasibility of resistance exercise is needed to consider its implementation in boys with DMD.\n\nThe goal of this project is to assess the safety and feasibility of a home based mild to moderate-intensity strengthening exercise program in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Evidence from milder forms of muscular dystrophy and mouse models of DMD suggests that strengthening exercise may be beneficial for these children, but this area has not been adequately explored using human subjects.

Although a variety of promising new treatment strategies are in development, outcome measures for clinical trials remain limited for the most part to a set of functional measures, such as the six-minute walk test. While clearly useful, such measures are impacted by unrelated factors, such as mood and effort, and have limited repeatability. To address this and other limitations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is now being investigated as a surrogate measure. However, more easily applied, cost-effective, office-based surrogate measures that provide high repeatability and sensitivity while still correlating strongly to disease status would find wider use in Phase II and possibly in Phase III clinical trials in DMD. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) and electrical impedance myography (EIM) are two techniques that could serve in this role. In QUS, muscle pathology (fibrosis and fatty infiltration) in DMD results in an increase in energy reflected back (backscatter) to the ultrasound. The amount of backscatter can be measured directly by analyzing the raw frequency-based acoustic data or indirectly by controlled processing of the gray-scale image. EIM, in contrast, relies upon the application of localized electrical current and measurement of the resulting surface voltages, but is similarly impacted by the fibrotic changes that develop as muscle disease progresses. Here, the investigators propose to evaluate and compare both methodologies simultaneously in a group of DMD patients and normal subjects in order to assess their ability to identify clinically meaningful alterations in muscle health over short intervals of time. As a final exploratory analysis, the investigators will also study the possibility of combining the two modalities. The results of this work will have broad application as they could be applied to a variety of neuromuscular conditions, including other muscular dystrophies. Thus, the hypothesis of this proposal is that both QUS and EIM can serve as convenient, non-invasive, clinically meaningful surrogate markers of disease progression in DMD that surpass the functional measures currently in use."],"EnrollmentCount":["73"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":66,"NCTId":["NCT02420379"],"OfficialTitle":["An Open-Label, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy and Tolerability of Eteplirsen in Early Stage Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["This is an open-label study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of eteplirsen in patients with early stage Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who are amenable to exon 51 skipping."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["June 30, 2015"],"CompletionDate":["December 17, 2018"],"DetailedDescription":["Safety, including adverse event monitoring and routine laboratory assessments, will be followed on an ongoing basis for all patients.\n\nClinical efficacy, including functional tests and MRI, will be assessed at regularly scheduled study visits.

The manifestation of muscle weakness typically starts around the age of 4-5 in males and deteriorates fast. Typically muscle loss occurs first in the upper legs and pelvis followed by muscles of the upper arms. It is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein dystrophin. Dystrophin is crucial to maintain the muscle fiber cell membrane.\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Corrective surgery, braces, and physical therapy may help with some of the symptoms. Assisted ventilation might be required in patients with weakness of breathing muscles. Medications prescribed include steroids to slow muscle degeneration, anti-convulsants to control seizures and muscle activity, and immunosuppressants to delay damage to muscle cells.\n\nFor decades, research has been conducted to find an effective therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Stem cell based therapy is considered to be one of the most promising methods for treating muscular dystrophies.\n\nStem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) can proceed via two strategies. The first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.\n\nHerein, the investigators describe a method for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) using autologous bone marrow derived specific populations of stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells transplanted in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)."],"EnrollmentCount":["20"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":87,"NCTId":["NCT03603288"],"OfficialTitle":["A Phase III Open-Label Extension Study to Assess the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Idebenone in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Who Completed the SIDEROS Study"],"OverallStatus":["Terminated"],"Phase":["Phase 3"],"BriefSummary":["The purpose of the study is to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of idebenone in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) who completed the SIDEROS study."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["July 4, 2018"],"CompletionDate":["November 25, 2020"],"DetailedDescription":["The study is an open-label, single-group, multi-center extension study in patients with DMD receiving glucocorticoid steroids who participated in the SIDEROS study and who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria for this extension study.\n\nThe study consists of 4 study visits scheduled every 6 months (Visit 1/Baseline, Visit 2/Week 26, Visit 3/ Week 52 and Visit 4/ Week 78), and a follow-up visit 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation.

Different sounds were provided as feedback for either a hit or miss during acquisition, retention and transfer, the range of error being -200 to 200ms.\n\nParticipants with DMD and TD were divided into two subgroups randomly: (a) button-press task group (BPT) - in this group during the acquisition phase the participants should press the space button on keyboard to complete the coincidence timing task (more real interface) and (b) gesture task group (GT) - in this group during the acquisition phase the participants should cross a virtual target created by a webcam to complete the coincidence timing task instead of press the computer button (more virtual interface).\n\nFor all tasks (button-press and gesture), during the acquisition phase, all groups started performing 20 attempts of the coincidence timing task and, after five minutes with no contact with the task, they performed five more repetitions for the retention phase (both phases in slower speed - with the turning on and off of the lights in an interval of 400ms), finally they performed five repetitions for two different transfers phases: the first transfer was performed with a faster speed - 300ms of lights interval (transfer with speed increase - TSI). The second transfer was performed with change task (transfer with exchange of en vironment - TEE) between groups by doing 5 attempts transfer phase in another interface.

Males with DMD typically die in the third and fourth decades of life of cardiopulmonary disease. Mouse models of DMD, autopsy data, and in vivo human studies using magnetic resonance-based late gadolinium enhancement imaging (LGE) have shown that progressive myocardial damage is well underway before left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) becomes abnormal.\n\nExertional symptoms and signs of myocardial disease are typically absent as skeletal muscle disease progressively limits functional capacity in affected boys. Thus, cardiac involvement can go undetected until LV dysfunction and myocardial fibrosis are advanced. While echocardiography remains a useful tool to evaluate LV dysfunction, CMR with LGE is advantageous for DMD patients since it identifies myocardial injury before decline in EF is apparent by echocardiography. Further, greater reproducibility affords efficient sample sizes for cardiomyopathy clinical trials in patients with rare diseases. CMR's increasing availability at DMD clinical centers has afforded earlier cardiomyopathy detection, and has helped refine current management to typically include agents such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) once damage is evident. This strategy, however, may not be sufficient, with prior studies showing decline in systolic function with or without ACEI or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy.\n\nThe investigators previously tested mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism (MRA) added to ACEI while EF was still normal in a mouse model that mimics the myocardial damage seen in DMD patients. This combination significantly reduced myocardial injury and improved (made more negative) LV circumferential strain (Ecc), a sensitive and early marker of LV systolic dysfunction. Additionally, preliminary findings from a recently completed clinical trial suggests efficacy of eplerenone vs. placebo, while further preclinical data suggests greater benefit without concomitant steroid use.

Currently, no known cure exists and treatments that benefit patients diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy are limited. New approaches, such as cell therapy, gene transfer, and pharmacological interventions have shown promising results in animal models and human studies with great potential to develop as effective therapeutic treatments. One of the major limitations of testing these interventions; however. is the lack of effective methods to monitor cellular and tissue changes taking place in the response to therapy. The ability to determine cellular and tissue specific changes in damaged muscles in real time, non-invasively, repeatedly, without exposure to any harmful radiations, with minimal patient discomfort, and at low operating cost would enable high throughput and faster investigation of potential therapies.\n\nThe proposed study focuses on the development of Optical Imaging technologies in the near infrared range of wavelengths to differentiate damaged from normal muscle tissue. Near infrared light (700 - 900 nm) has demonstrated the ability to deeply penetrate through biological tissue, skin, and muscle without appreciable attenuation or auto-fluorescence.\n\nThe investigators anticipate that Indocyanine Green enhanced Optical Imaging can be used to image exercise induced acute muscle damage in healthy individuals and damaged muscle and in boys with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Pathogenetically, there is a deficiency of dystrophin, a structural protein of the sarcolemma, which is caused by mutations (usually deletions) of the dystrophin gene (Xp21.3-p21.2). The result of dystrophin deficiency is a necrosis of muscle cells that are replaced by connective tissue and adipose tissue. Clinical scores (6-minute walk test, 6MWT) and MRI studies to characterize the degenerative changes of skeletal muscle in the early stages are available for the quantitative assessment of the disease progression as well as therapy effects, the significance of which is controversially discussed. However, the highly sensitive assessment of gene therapy effects (e.g., PTC 124) will become increasingly important in the future. Sensitive, non-invasive methods for the detection of early muscle degeneration and muscle function in the course are of great clinical and scientific importance. The purpose of this first pilot study is to investigate whether the differences in skeletal muscle composition of healthy volunteers and ambulatory patients with early stage DMD can be quantified and characterized using multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT). This could in the future generate a completely new, non-invasive method to develop non-invasive biomarkers of disease progression or therapy response."],"EnrollmentCount":["20"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Diagnostic"]},{"Rank":155,"NCTId":["NCT04337112"],"OfficialTitle":["The Expanded Access Use of Viltolarsen for the Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) Amenable to Exon 53 Skipping"],"OverallStatus":["Approved for marketing"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["This is an open label expanded access program for boys, 3 to 12 years old, for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with confirmed mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene that is amenable to skipping of exon 53."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":[],"CompletionDate":[],"DetailedDescription":["This expanded access program is designed to provide access to viltolarsen in patients with DMD with confirmed mutation(s) in the dystrophin gene amenable to skipping of exon 53, who in the opinion and clinical judgement of the treating physician, would benefit from treatment with viltolarsen."],"EnrollmentCount":[],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":156,"NCTId":["NCT05096221"],"OfficialTitle":["A Phase 3 Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Systemic Gene Delivery Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of SRP-9001 in Patients With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (EMBARK)"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 3"],"BriefSummary":["The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of gene transfer therapy in boys with DMD.

This mutation leads to deficiency of dystrophin in the myofibers, causing progressive muscle degeneration by the following mechanism: (1) dystrophin deficiency leads to myofibers being very vulnerable to muscle contraction-relaxation, causing frequent damage and necrosis of myofibers; (2) necrosis is followed by myofiber regeneration, as long as the regenerative capacity of muscle is not exhausted; (3) when the regenerative capacity of the muscle is exhausted, myofibers become atrophic and are ultimately lost; (4) fibrosis and fat infiltration replace the lost myofibers. This progressive muscle destruction takes place in most muscles of the limbs and trunk, leading to progressive loss of muscle strength, musculotendinous contractures, restrictive respiratory insufficiency and premature death between 17 and 30 years.\n\nThe transplantation of myoblasts obtained from a healthy donor is a potential treatment of DMD. Following intramuscular injection, donor myoblasts fuse with the myofibers of the patient, introducing the normal dystrophin gene in them. In a previous Phase 1A clinical trial, the investigators proved that transplantation of myoblasts grown from the muscle biopsy of a healthy donor introduced the normal dystrophin gene in the DMD myofibers, with the consequent expression of the normal dystrophin mRNA and restoration of the dystrophin protein in several myofibers.\n\nThe aim of this Phase I/II of the clinical trial is to investigate whether the transplantation of normal myoblasts throughout one muscle (in this case, the extensor carpi radialis) of DMD patients is safe and will improve the strength of that muscle. The patients will be transplanted with myoblasts grown from the muscle biopsy of a healthy donor. Thirty million myoblasts will be injected per cm cube in a progressively higher volume of muscle (i.e., 3, 6 and 9 cm cube). The contralateral muscle will be injected with saline as a control. The patients and the investigators will be blind to the side injected with cells. The strength of both muscles will be measured at 3 months post transplant to verify if myoblast transplantation increased muscle strength. If there is no significant strength increase, the protocol will be terminated immediately for that patient. If there is a significant strength increase, the patient will be maintained under immunosuppression until 6 months and the muscle strength will be re-evaluated.\n\nThe objectives of this Phase I/II clinical trial with DMD patients are thus:\n\nPrimary objective:\n\nTo evaluate the safety of a procedure of high-density injections of donor myoblasts throughout a muscle (under immunosuppression by tacrolimus).\n\nSecondary objectives:\n\nTo evaluate whether myoblast transplantation resulted in the presence of dystrophin-positive myofibers of donor origin.\n\nTo evaluate whether myoblast transplantation improved the muscle strength or prevent or slowed down the progression of the muscle weakness as shown by the following parameters:\n\n2.1) Increase of the voluntary strength of the subject's wrist extension done by the extensor carpi radialis 12 or 24 weeks after myoblast transplantation compared with the pre-transplant values of the same muscle.\n\n2.2) Reduction of the fatigue of the voluntary strength of the subject's wrist extension done by the extensor carpi radialis 12 or 24 weeks after myoblast transplantation compared with the pre-transplant fatigue values of the same muscle.\n\n2.3) Reduce the progression of the muscle weakness in the myoblast injected muscle compared with the control contralateral muscle.\n\nTo verify the long term effectiveness of the tacrolimus immunosuppression to control acute rejection in myoblast transplantation (by examining the presence of muscle fibers expressing normal dystrophin and the absence of specific immune responses)"],"EnrollmentCount":["10"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":159,"NCTId":["NCT03589573"],"OfficialTitle":["Effect of Trunk and Lower Extremity Muscle Strength on Hamstring Flexibility in Children With Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["Investigator researched that the effect of trunk and lower extremity muscle strength on hamstring flexibility in children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["March 24, 2017"],"CompletionDate":["January 1, 2018"],"DetailedDescription":["Thirty children were asessed by physical therapist.

It is caused by a mutation in the gene for dystrophin, a protein that is important for maintaining normal muscle structure and function.

A specific type of mutation, called a nonsense (premature stop codon) mutation is the cause of DMD/BMD in approximately 10-15% of boys with the disease. Ataluren (PTC124) is an orally delivered, investigational drug that has the potential to overcome the effects of the nonsense mutation.

GSK2402968 is thought to correct several genetic mutations through skipping of exon 51 and therefore targets only those boys with these mutations.\n\nA reasonable hypothesis is that increasing dystrophin will result in clinical improvement, and that the amount of dystrophin expressed will correlate with clinical improvement above a threshold level (e.g. around 30% of control).

Based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling, it is predicted at steady-state that the 6 mg/kg/week dose will induce dystrophin expression greater than 30% of control. The 3 mg/kg/week dose was chosen as modeling predicts 3 mg/kg/week of GSK2402968 will produce dystrophin expression in the range of 18-22%.

Blood flow studies will be performed with the subject's lower body enclosed in an airtight chamber. Blood flow and oxygen delivery to the forearm muscles will be measured before and during application of lower body negative pressure at rest and during handgrip exercise. Lower body negative pressure simulates the blood flow changes that normally occur when a person sits up after lying down.\n\nThe results of the baseline study will determine which patients meet preset eligibility criteria to participate in the medication phase of the study. These criteria include (1) normal kidney and liver function tests and normal BNP levels (the latter to exclude heart failure), and (2) abnormal MRI and blood flow responses to handgrip exercise.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is one of the most devastating genetically linked neuromuscular diseases and is characterized by the absence of dystrophin, resulting in progressive muscle weakness, loss of walking ability and premature death. Despite the poor prognosis therapeutic interventions have been lacking, and outcome measures for clinical trials have been limited to measures of muscle function, quality of life, serum biomarkers of muscle breakdown and invasive muscle biopsies. Closely related to DMD, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) has also been largely neglected in therapeutic development, due to its heterogeneity, small patient population, lack of outcome measures and uncertainty surrounding the patterns of disease progression, which may be mutation-dependent. Additional quantitative outcome measures that are noninvasive and sensitive to changes in muscle structure and composition are needed to facilitate the rapid translation of promising new interventions from preclinical studies to clinical trials in both forms of muscular dystrophy. As such, this project targets the development and validation of magnetic resonance as a noninvasive biomarker of disease progression in muscular dystrophy. Using a multi-site research design this study will characterize the intramuscular lipid content, cellular muscle damage and contractile area in the lower and/or upper extremity muscles of 200 ambulatory or non-ambulatory boys/men with DMD, 105 ambulatory or non-ambulatory men with BMD, and 110 healthy age matched boys/men using a combination of sophisticated MRI and MRS technologies. The trunk and respiratory muscles will be characterized in a subgroup of subjects (80 DMD, 20 BMD and 10 controls). In order to assess the sensitivity of each MR measure individually as well as composite MR measures (combination of muscles) to disease progression, all boys/men with DMD or BMD will be re-evaluated in yearly or 6 month intervals. The predictive outcome value of MRI/MRS will be further evaluated by determining the relationship between changes in MR measures and loss in muscle strength and/or functional ability. Using MRI/MRS we will also examine the effect of initiating corticosteroid treatment on skeletal muscle characteristics and composition. Examination of muscles in BMD patients will allow us to increase our understanding of how much dystrophin is needed to protect the muscle. To this end we will specifically examine the relationship between the MR phenotype (e.g. fast or slow increases in fat fraction) and dystrophin mutations, dystrophin expression and other histological markers.

The pathology of DMD is a result of non-repaired muscle damage that leads to muscle-tissue replacement by scar tissue, a process known as fibrosis. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the disease. The only therapy offered to these boys are steroids which slightly delayed the disease progression. The boys lose their ability to walk at around the age of 12, and die in the 4th decade of life from severe heart and lung problems.\n\nIn this study investigators will test the efficacy of Tamoxifen treatment in ambulatory DMD boys. Tamoxifen is a drug used for palliative treatment of breast cancer patients and has an outstanding safety profile. In addition, Tamoxifen was tested in the past in boys, for other pediatric indications, and showed an excellent safety with no side effects.\n\nTamoxifen is being tested in this study, as a therapy for DMD, for the following reasons:\n\n(i) it was shown to have anti-fibrotic effect in multiple in-vivo systems; (ii) it assists in the repair of damaged muscles.\n\nIn other words, Tamoxifen is expected to have a synergistic effect on DMD patients, due to its dual mechanism of action.

Although it has been recommended by some experts as the \"standard of care\" for individuals with neuromuscular disease, the strategy has not been widely implemented in DMD given the lack of clinical trials to date to support its efficacy as well as the additional burden of care required in a population already requiring multiple interventions.\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine whether LVR, in addition to conventional treatment, is successful in reducing decline from baseline in forced vital capacity (FVC) over 2 years (percent predicted, measured according to American Thoracic Society standards), compared to conventional treatment alone in children with DMD.\n\nSecondary Objectives: To determine differences between children treated with LVR in addition to conventional treatment, compared to those treated with conventional treatment alone, in: (1) the number of courses of antibiotics, hospitalizations and intensive care admissions for respiratory exacerbations, (2) health-related quality of life, and (3) peak cough flow and other pulmonary function tests.\n\nMethods: We propose a 3-year multi-centre randomized controlled trial involving fifteen tertiary care pediatric hospitals across Canada. The study population consists of boys aged 6-16 years with DMD and FVC ≥ 30% of predicted. A sample size of 110 participants will be enrolled. This has been informed by chart review and survey of participating centres to be feasible, and will be re-assessed with an ongoing internal pilot study. Intervention: Participants will be allocated with a minimization procedure to receive conventional treatment (non-invasive ventilation, nutritional supplementation, physiotherapy and/or antibiotics, as decided by the treating physician) or conventional treatment plus twice daily LVR exercises performed with an inexpensive, portable self-inflating resuscitation bag containing a one-way valve and a mouthpiece. Data Analysis: The primary outcome (change in percent predicted FVC over 2 years) will be compared between the two study groups using an analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) that takes into account baseline FVC and minimization factors.\n\nImportance: Decline in pulmonary function among children with DMD negatively affects quality of life and predicts mortality. The relatively simple strategy of LVR has the potential to optimize pulmonary function and reduce respiratory exacerbations, thereby improving quality of life for individuals with DMD. This study is novel in that it is the first randomized controlled trial of LVR. A major strength is that the results will give support or refute recommendations regarding inclusion of LVR in the standard of care for individuals with DMD worldwide."],"EnrollmentCount":["70"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":278,"NCTId":["NCT01350154"],"OfficialTitle":["Does Modulation of the nNOS System in Patients With Muscular Dystrophy and Defect nNOS Signalling Affect Cardiac, Muscular or Cognitive Function?"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["This study is done to evaluate whether treatment with the drug sildenafil (Revatio®) can improve muscular, cardiac, cerebrovascular or cognitive function in patients with Beckers muscular dystrophy when compared to placebo (inactive medication).

It is an X-linked genetic progressive and degenerative myopathy characterized by progressive weakness, which can lead to loss of motor functions in puberty as well as cardiac,respiratory involvement and premature death. The disease is one of a group of myopathies that differ depending on the degree of severity and the affected muscle types. It occurs at a rate of approximately 1:3500 male births and arises due to spontaneous mutations in the Dystrophin gene (locus Xp21.2); 65% of causative mutations are intragenic deletions, 6-10% are intragenic duplications and 30-35% are point mutations (along with other sequence variations). The disease is caused by a deficiency of Dystrophin or the synthesis of functionally impotent Dystrophin, a critical protein component of the Dystrophin glycoprotein complex acting as a link between the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix in skeletal and cardiac muscles. A consequence of Dystrophin glycoprotein complex inefficiency is muscle fragility, contraction-induced damage, necrosis and inflammation.\n\nGlucocorticoid can prolong ambulation by 2 to 3 years, reduce scoliosis, and temper pulmonary and cardiac decline in the second decade of life. However, glucocorticoids causes well-known side effects, which are intolerable in more than 25% of patients. Thus, a disease-specific treatment is a major unmet need. Investigators have proposed various possibilities for the beneficial effects of corticosteroid based mainly on observations in mouse models of muscular dystrophy and on a limited number of studies in patients.\n\nThese possibilities include\n\nReducing cytotoxic T lymphocytes\nIncreasing Laminin expression and myogenic repair\nRetarding muscle apoptosis and cellular infiltration\nEnhancing Dystrophin expression\nAffecting neuromuscular transmission\n\nSome patients with Duchenne Myopathy treated early with steroids appear to have an improved long-term prognosis in muscle, myocardial outcome, and can help keep patients ambulatory for more years than expected without treatment. One protocol gives prednisone (0.75 mg/kg/day) for the 1st 10 days of each month to avoid chronic complications. Deflazacort, administered as 0.9 mg/kg/day, may be more effective than prednisone. The American Academy of Neurology and the Child Neurology Society recommend administering corticosteroids during the ambulatory stage of the disease.Published recommendations suggest starting therapy between 2 and 5 years of age in boys whose strength has plateaued or is declining, but earlier treatment may be more beneficial.\n\nSkeletal muscle has a great capacity to regenerate following muscle wasting caused by trauma or disease.This regenerative potential is attributed primarily to skeletal-muscle resident stem cells called satellite cells. In Duchenne Myopathy, satellite cells are exhausted following many rounds of muscle degeneration and regeneration. Hence, satellite cells and their progeny (myoblasts) have been considered as a promising candidate for cell replacement therapy for DMD and other types of muscle disease. Small quantities of adult stem cells exist in most tissues throughout the body where they remain quiescent for long periods of time prior to being activated in response to disease or tissue injury. Adult stem cells can be isolated from cells of the hematopoietic, neural, dermal, muscle and hepatic systems. Adult stem cells give rise to cell types of the tissue from which they originated, but according to scientific reports, they can differentiate into lineages other than their tissue of origin, e.g. transplanted bone marrow or enriched hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were reported to give rise to cells of the mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm.\n\nTwo main types of stem cells usually derived from adult bone marrow are HSCs and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). They can sometimes be obtained from fat, skin, periosteum, synovial membrane and muscle as well. MSCs are multipotent and capable of differentiating into several connective tissue types including osteocytes, chondrocytes, adipocytes, tenocytes and myoblasts. They can also impose an additional anti-inflammatory and paracrine effect on differentiation and tissue regeneration via cytokine pathways and have anti-apoptotic features. These genetically determined pluripotent cells may be easily isolated from bone marrow because they have membrane proteins (marker called cluster of differentiation (CD34 +) and specific marker STRO-I). Compared with pluripotent embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, mesenchymal stem cell have a greater biosafety profile and lower risk of tumorigenicity, and perhaps that is why numerous -mesenchymal stem cell based therapies have made it to the clinical trial stage. Stem cell based therapies for the treatment of Duchenne Myopathy can proceed via two strategies.\n\nThe first is autologous stem cell transfer involving cells from a patient with Duchenne Myopathy that are genetically altered in vitro to restore dystrophin expression and are subsequently re-implanted. The second is allogenic stem cell transfer, containing cells from an individual with functional dystrophin, which are transplanted into a dystrophic patient.\n\nIntramuscular route of administration can be considered most appropriate as muscular dystrophy is primarily a muscle disease. The cells can be injected in several points in the muscle alternatively they can be injected in the motor point of the muscle. A motor point is the point at which the motor branch of the innervating nerve enters the muscle. It is the point with the highest concentration of motor endplates and myoneural synapses. Due to high numbers of neuromuscular junctions at this point, a muscle contraction can be easily elicited using minimal electric stimulus. Motor points can therefore be identified as superficial points directly over the points on the muscles with help of external electrical stimulation. Limitation of this method is that only superficial muscles can be stimulated using this method.\n\nIn an open study, Sharma and colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of autologous bone marrow mononuclear transplantation by intramuscularly to patients with Duchenne Myopathy, Becker muscular dystrophy and limb girdle muscular dystrophy. However, they did not provide the molecular diagnosis of these dystrophies. No significant adverse events were noted. An increase in trunk muscle strength was seen in 53% of the cases, 48% showed an increase in upper limb strength, 59% showed an increase in lower limb strength and approximately 10% showed improved gait.

DBMD is described as a complex chronic condition causing challenges exemplified by both chronic and terminal illnesses. Parental adaptation to a child s DBMD diagnosis is multifaceted due to the evolution of the disease and uncertain timing of the progressive losses the child and family face. In addition to prognostic uncertainty associated with DBMD, there is uncertainty about the management of the condition, future and reproductive planning, the family s social connections, and the existential meaning of the child s life. It is not fully understood how mothers of children with DBMD appraise, cope with, and ultimately adapt to their child s condition in light of this uncertainty. While high degrees of perceived uncertainty may be seen as a threat to coping and adaptation, there is evidence that caregivers may find benefits in uncertainty.

Dosing regimen vary for DMD, but most trials utilized oral daily dosing at 0.75- 1 mg/kg of prednisone or deflazacort (Birnkrant et al., 2018). The age at which to begin oral glucocorticoids and the age at which to cease steroid use are not well established by clinical trial investigation. High dose weekend dosing of oral glucocorticoid steroids has also been suggested to be noninferior to daily dosing when evaluated in a year-long study in DMD, and this approach is preferred in some settings since related to a reduced side effect profile, particularly with respect to behavioral changes which can occur with daily GC steroid dosing in children (Escolar et al., 2011). The use of GC steroids for other forms of muscular dystrophy, including Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) and the Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies (LGMDs) is not considered standard of care and has insufficiently been investigated by randomized clinical trials (RCT). An RCT of GC steroids in LGMD 2B (DYSF mutations) was associated with unfavorable outcomes in the steroid treated group (Walter et al., 2013).\n\nRecently, weekly steroid dosing was investigated in preclinical mouse models of muscular dystrophy, including the mdx mouse model of DMD/BMD and two models of LGMD, including LGMD 2B (DYSF) and 2C (SGCG) (Quattrocelli et al., 2017a; Quattrocelli et al., 2017b). All three models showed improved strength and reduced fibrosis with weekly GC steroid dosing. Moreover, in unpublished data, long term studies (24-52 weeks duration) in mice, showed favorable results with improved muscle strength in the mdx and DYSF models.\n\nThe investigators propose to carry out an open label safety and efficacy trial of oral weekly GC steroids in patients with BMD and LGMD subtypes. Subjects will be recruited based on age, molecular diagnosis of BMD and LGMD subtypes, and willingness to participate. Both ambulatory and nonambulatory subjects will be included. Subjects will be excluded if they have diabetes mellitus, full time ventilator use, or severely compromised cardiac function, including symptoms referable to heart failure. Subjects must provide consent.\n\nSubjects will be asked to take weekly GC oral prednisone dosed based on weight (1mg/kg for patients who weigh less than or equal to 70 kg and 0.75 mg/kg for patients who weigh more than 70 kg).

Most side effects (Cushingoid faces, linear growth arrest, and bone density loss) did not happen in infants and in ambulatory boys in two separate studies.

The Hanover Curriculum has been established as a treatment programme for psychosomatic aftercare. This comprises 25 weekly group sessions and two single therapies at the beginning and at the end of the therapy.\n\nIn Germany a vast majority of rehabilitants in a psychosomatic rehabilitation clinic has an indication for psychosomatic aftercare, but it is used only by less than half of the patients due to a lack of aftercare therapists. If there is a therapist in the patient's vicinity, there are often long travelling times to the therapist or the patients might feel stigmatized participating in a face-to-face therapy.\n\nThus, the expansion of internet-based aftercare services is recommended. Advantages are that they can be carried out at home, possible cost and time savings and improvement of the care situation.\n\nSeveral meta-analyses provide high evidence for the effectiveness of internet-based therapy offers in depressive and anxiety disorders that are frequent among psychosomatic rehabilitation patients. First randomised controlled studies show that internet-based aftercare services can lead to a symptomatic improvement and to a reduction of relapses. It is currently not clear whether established aftercare concepts, such as the Curriculum Hannover, are also effective in an internet-based format (Curriculum Hannover Online).\n\nThe present project consists of a superiority study, examining whether participation in Curriculum- Hannover-Online leads to a stronger adoption and maintenance of the health improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation in comparison to care as usual, and an equivalnece study, examining, wether the Curriculum Hannover Online is an equivalent treatment option to the existing face-to-face aftercare therapy."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["March 1, 2017"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["The use of information and communication technology with the aim of promoting mental health can be described as \"e-Mental Health\", which is regularly used synonymously with the term \"internet-based interventions\".\n\nWith regard to the study situation on internet-based aftercare interventions, especially in Germany, the research is in an early phase. An overview of the possible uses of internet-based treatment approaches in rehabilitation can be found in Lin, Ebert, Lehr, Berking and Baumeister (2013) and - based on the contributions of the Rehabilitation Science Colloquium since 2008 - Baumeister, Lin and Ebert (2013). However, the first randomised controlled studies on aftercare show, in agreement with the studies outlined above, that corresponding offers led to a reduction in relapses compared to Care as Usual (CAU) (Bauer, Okon, Meermann, Kordy, 2013; Ebert, Tarnowski, Gollwitzer, Sieland& Berking, 2013).Both interventions represent new conceptual developments. Regarding the positive findings on the effectiveness of internet-based interventions and with a view to the suboptimal care situation, Kobelt, Winkler and Petermann (2011), for example, recommend the expansion of internet-based aftercare services and their evaluation.\n\nThe planned project aims to develop an internet-based variant of the aftercare concept Curriculum Hannover (Curriculum-Hannover-Online), to integrate it into routine care and to test its effectiveness. The technology of the virtual classroom is particularly suitable for internet-based interventions providing group therapy (cf. Wolever et al., 2012).\n\nFor this purpose, the existing manual for Curriculum Hannover (cf. Kobelt et al., 2002) is adapted in the course of the process for the needs of an online intervention. The therapists will be prepared for the specifics of the medium through a train-the-trainer-training for learning how to specifically establish and maintain a therapeutic relationship between therapist and participants. It is assumed that this new program for outpatient aftercare after inpatient psychosomatic rehabilitation can be an effective and useful therpy for patients who do not have access to the existing face-to-face aftercare therapies.. The Virtual Classroom is a direct, video- or audio-synchronous and multimedia contact between therapist and patient.\n\nThe main question of the superiority study is:\n\nA. Does participation in the Curriculum-Hannover-Online lead to improved uptake and maintenance of the health improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation? B. Can the implementation of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online be designed in such a way that its use as a routine procedure in rehabilitation can be recommended? C. Can the Curriculum-Hannover-Online be accepted by the relevant stakeholders to the same extent as the face-to-face version of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online? For the successful introduction of a new treatment approach, in addition to the proof of its effectiveness, significant challenges have to be overcome with regard to the organisation of work processes, the involvement of all actors involved in the process (especially patients, practitioners, management).\n\nThe main question of the equivalence study is:\n\nA.Does participation in the Curriculum-Hannover-Online lead to an equivalent adoption and maintenance of the health improvements achieved in inpatient rehabilitation? B. Can the implementation of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online in addition to the offer of the face-to-face variant be designed in such a way that its use as a rou- tine procedure in rehabilitation can be recommended? C.Can the Curriculum-Hannover-Online be accepted by the relevant stakeholders to the same extent as the face-to-face version of the Curriculum-Hannover-Online? D.Can characteristics be identified that allow a differential indication for the recommendation to participate in the Curriculum Hannover in its online or face-to-face variant? E.What are the additional advantages of the Curriculum Hannover Online from the perspective of patients, therapists, service providers and health care providers?

Importantly, by implementing and testing a novel conceptual framework, the results will be relevant not only to pain research but also to a broader neuroscientific community, because the expected results also relate to affective and motivational processes in other diseases (e.g. depression, anxiety, Parkinson's disease). The proposed project offers novel avenues to pain treatment based on pharmacological and psychological mechanisms-based approach instead of being symptoms-oriented as most available pain treatments at the moment.\n\nThis study entails more than minimal risks and burdens for participants, because both substudies incorporate the intake of drugs. However, both substudies comprise only low doses and/or single doses. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) will be administered in substudy 1 for 12 weeks in chronic pain patients with fibromyalgia to down-regulate microglial activation. Previous studies indicated only very few side-effects. In substudy 2, patients with fibromyalgia and healthy participants will receive a single dose of the dopamine agonist bromocriptine (1.25 mg, p.o.) or a placebo in separate testing sessions. Healthy participants will receive in an additional testing session a single dose of the dopamine antagonist amisulpride (400 mg, p.o.). Both drugs have been repeatedly used in research with the same dosages with no or very few side effects. The methods that will be used in the experimental testing sessions are within the range of standard procedures in pain research and experimental psychology and are frequently used in healthy participants and patients. Experimental pain stimulation will be adjusted to individual pain sensitivity, rendering the applied stimulation tolerable. Magnetic resonance imaging, including spectroscopy, will be performed without a contrast medium. Peripheral venous blood sampling will be performed by an expert medical professional. The risk of unauthorized data access or unwanted identification of participants will be minimized by the use of restricted access to data and facilities, lockable cabinets, and password protected computers.\n\nSub-study 1:\n\nThe sample will be divided into two groups, one receiving low dose naltrexone (LDN), the other placebo for 12 weeks. Before and after this 12 week pharmacological intervention, each patient will undergo a MRI testing session at Balgrist Campus, Balgrist Hospital Zürich. A placebocontrolled design is chosen here in addition to the pre-/post-pharmacological intervention comparison, because microglia activation has been investigated only a few times in chronic pain patients so far and due to unknown possible natural variation in microglia activation.\n\nWritten consent will be obtained from each participant after explaining the purpose and the course of the experiment. At the beginning of each testing session, pain assessments will be performed, which include assessment of participants' individual heat pain threshold and tolerance. After this assessment, a blood sample will be taken to assess the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), after which participants will be positioned inside the MRI scanner for magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and to acquire fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) images while participants will perform a behavioral discrimination task and an avoidance task to assess sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain components. After completion of these tasks, resting state fMRI will be performed followed by a structural fMRI acquisition. Further, participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires. In addition, some trait questionnaires will be filled out during the first testing session. The duration of each of MRI testing session will be 2.5-3h.\n\nSub-study 2:\n\nThe sample consists of fibromyalgia patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls. While healthy controls undergo three testing sessions to assess the effects of a dopamine receptor antagonist and agonist in comparison to placebo, fibromyalgia patients do only two testing sessions assessing only the effects of a dopamine agonist in comparison to a placebo, because for these patients the presence of a hypodopaminergic state is assumed. Thus, each session comprises the intake of a single dose of a drug or placebo and MRI scanning. Healthy controls will take in amisulpride (dopamine receptor antagonist), bromocriptine (dopamine receptor agonist), and placebo and fibromyalgia patients bromocriptine and placebo in a counterbalanced order. At the beginning of the first session, written consent will be obtained from the participants after explaining them the purpose and the course of the experiment. After intake of the capsules containing drug/placebo, there will be a waiting period to reach the peak plasma concentration of the drugs during MRI scanning. During this waiting period, participants will fill out some questionnaires. Before the MRI scanning, in each testing session, pain assessments will be performed, which includes assessment of participants individual heat pain threshold and tolerance. This will be followed by taking a blood sample to determine prolactin levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines, neurofilaments, dopamine gene related polymorphisms after which participants will be positioned inside the MRI scanner. During MRI scanning, participants will perform a behavioral discrimination task and an avoidance task to assess sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain components. After completion of these tasks, resting state fMRI will be performed followed by a structural MRI acquisition for obtaining anatomical images. The duration for each testing session is 2.5-3h.\n\nSample sizes for substudy 1 and 2 are based on a priori sample size calculations using G*Power 3.1 with a desired medium effect size f= 0.25, alpha = 0.05, beta= 0.95, repeated measures ANOVA within-between subject designs, and an attrition rate of 10%. Outcome variables will be analyzed in separate mixed model analyses for ANOVA designs with appropriate within- and between-subject factors. Associations of primary endpoints with questionnaire scores (secondary outcomes) will be analyzed using Pearson- or Spearman correlation coefficients, where appropriate. Significance levels will be set to 5%, adjusted with false discovery rate for multiple testing. Effect sizes will be calculated in terms of generalized eta-squared (ηG2) and Cohen's d. Spectroscopy data will be analyzed using a linear combination model. Concentrations of MI, Cho, and NAA (N-Acetyl Aspartate) will be computed using peak height relative to creatine (Cr) and compared using mixed model analyses for ANOVA designs. Images from fMRI analysis of each participant will undergo standard preprocessing (including high-pass filtering, motion correction, spatial smoothing) and will be entered into a voxel-wise analysis using a general linear model to estimate the effects of pharmacological interventions on pain-related brain activity related to emotional-motivational and sensory-discriminative pain responses. For all brain analyses, a voxel-threshold of p<0.01 and a cluster threshold for spatial extent of p<0.05 will be employed.\n\nWithin this study, pharmacological interventions, psychophysical methods, and magnetic resonance imaging will be utilized to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms involved in a negative hedonic shift in chronic pain. Low dose naltrexone will transiently down-regulate neuroinflammation in chronic pain patients. Pharmacological interventions (amisulpride and bromocriptine) will only cause a transient manipulation of dopaminergic system in both healthy controls and fibromyalgia patients. The pharmacological interventions proposed in the current study does not have a clinical intervention value, instead they are only used for the purpose of investigating psychobiological mechanisms underlying chronic pain. Psychophysical methods will allow the investigators to dissociate the emotional-motivational component of pain from its sensory discriminant component. Magnetic resonance imaging will allow the investigators to investigate brain responses and neuroinflammation in relation to chronic pain. Based on these methods, the investigators will get insights on the role of dopamine and fronto-striatal connectivity in regulating the emotional component of pain in chronic pain. The usage of the pharmacological interventions in this study hold more than minimal risks for the participants, but according to previous research studies, in which the same dosage of these pharmacologic drugs were used, only minimal side-effects have been observed (see above \"Risk/Benefit Assessment\"). Psychophysical methods and pharmacological interventions based on experimental psychology and pain research will be used in this study. These methods have been shown to be successful in investigating the different aspects of pain perception and modulation of pain perception. The methods used are in the standard range of methods from human pain research and experimental psychology.

The tasks will be performed in counterbalanced order. After obtaining written informed consent, participants' individual heat pain threshold and tolerance will be determined, based on which the stimulation intensity to be used in the discrimination and the avoidance task will be calculated. After this assessment, participants either perform the discrimination or the avoidance task. Within the discrimination task, participants have to indicate whether they perceived a small increase in temperature or not. In the avoidance task, participants can avoid a painful stimulation by reacting fast enough to a visual cue. Participants will be randomly (balanced randomization) assigned to one of two learning conditions, either reinforcing successful discrimination or avoidance, to increase sensory-discriminative or emotional-motivational pain responses. Reinforcement, implemented by small monetary wins, will start depending on the condition after half the trials of the discrimination or the avoidance task. Subjective ratings of perceived pain intensity and unpleasantness will be assessed within both tasks as control variables to test whether increases in sensory-discriminative or emotional-motivational pain processing generalize to the subjective response channel.

Healthy volunteers (N=30) will be recruited. During testing session participants will perform a psychophysical task to assess metacognition in pain perception as an indicator of the cognitive-evaluative pain component. The objective is to assess whether metacognition on pain perception are involved and subjective ratings of perceived pain and how metacognition relates to pain intensity. After obtaining written informed consent, participants' individual heat pain threshold and tolerance will be determined, based on which the stimulation intensity to be used in the experiment will be calculated. After this assessment, participants perform the cognitive pain task. Within this task, participants have to indicate whether they perceived a first or second heat pain stimulus as higher in intensity, whether the higher one was perceived as painful or not, and their confidence in both these answers. In addition, participants will complete several questionnaires to investigate whether certain personality traits and personal states are related to metacognition in pain.\n\nThe sample size of Substudy 3 is determined according to Kreft and Leeuw (2007) after which a great enough power will be reached with a sample size of 30 participants and 30 observations to identify cross-level interactions. Substudy 3 follows a within subject design with repeated measures. The tasks that will be performed by each participant include the within-subject factor 'temperature difference' (differences in temperature between first and second stimulus) and the within-subject factor 'temperature level' (temperature relative to individual pain threshold of each stimulus). The order of the different conditions in each task will be applied using a balanced pseudo-randomized order. For testing hypothesis 1ai, 1bi and 1c t-test will be conducted. For Hypothesis 1aii and 1bii chi square tests are planned. To test hypothesis 2a, 2c and 3 logistic hierarchic liner models and for hypothesis 2b and 2d hierarchic linear models will be performed.\n\nWithin this study methods that allow the separation of different components of the perception of pain will be developed and validated and which are currently not available. In addition, based on theses methods, a human model on how such components of pain can dissociate will be developed, thereby allowing investigating a prominent assumption on factors that crucially contribute to the development and maintenance of chronic pain. The expected results will form the basis for the development of novel mechanism-based pain therapies.\n\nPsychophysical methods based on experimental psychology and pain research will be used, which have been shown before to be successful in investigating different aspects of pain perception and the modulation of pain perception.

This lack of medical explanation severely hampers diagnostic procedures and effective treatments. For such unspecific pain, strong influences of emotional and cognitive factors are known. However, the majority of pain research focuses on molecular and neuronal mechanisms of nociception (i.e. the neural encoding and processing of actually or potentially tissue-damaging events) without relating such processes to the subjective experience of and suffering from pain and modulatory psychological emotional-motivational influences. Considering the large category of unspecific pain and the fact that effective treatment is lacking, more research following a mechanism-oriented framework focusing on emotional-motivational pain components and related psychological mechanisms is needed, as done here.\n\nThe perception of pain is multidimensional: The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage\", highlighting the crucial point that pain always comprises emotional components. Specifically, pain comprises sensory-discriminative, emotional-motivational and cognitive-evaluative components as initially proposed in Melzack's tripartite model of pain. Typically, the sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational components are well aligned; but these components can dissociate. For example, many people find a painful massage pleasant or enjoy eating hot chilies, likely through a reappraisal of the painful sensation. Extreme examples are prefrontal lobotomy, cingulotomy or strong morphine analgesia where pain is still recognized in its sensory-discriminative dimension, but loses its aversiveness and threat. Such a loss of emotional-motivational pain components can lead to severe injuries and life-threatening conditions. Although these examples affect only very few people, they illustrate a conceptually important point: Emotional-motivational aspects are the driving force in pain.\n\nThe dissociation of pain components: As described above and as an idea inherent to Melzack's tripartite model of pain, the different pain components can dissociate. The underlying mechanisms how such a dissociation can develop and be maintained are largely unclear. Based on earlier findings, operant and associative learning mechanisms appear to be likely candidates.\n\nApplying the mechanisms of associative conditioning, a counterconditioning experiment showed impressively a dissociation between sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain components. Counterconditioning is a specific form of classical conditioning used to reduce negative stimulus valence through a new association between a behavior and a stimulus of an oppositive valence. For example, Eroféeva applied this principle in the context of pain, pairing a positive stimulus (food) with an aversive painful stimulus in dogs. The appetitive response to the positive stimulus gradually and completely replaced aversive pain responses, suggesting that the pain lost its aversiveness, thus diminishing its emotional-motivational component. However, since the dogs still utilized the painful stimulus to predict the rewarding stimulus, sensory-discriminative pain components must have been preserved. This example illustrates that learning might be a mechanism underlying a gradual dissociation of sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain components.\n\nThe negative hedonic shift in chronic pain: In line with the observation that learning related to a dissociation of different pain components can be altered, emotional-motivational components appear to dominate over sensory-discriminative components in chronic pain. For example, the influential Fear-Avoid-ance Model of Pain termed chronic pain as \"exaggerated pain perception\" in its earliest version, because of disproportionally augmented emotional-motivational relative to sensory-discriminative pain components. Such increased emotional-motivational pain perception is often reflected in chronic pain patients in heightened pain aversiveness and pain avoidance behavior. Further and in line with such increases, recent findings suggest that pain processing is characterized by a functional shift from nociceptive to non-nociceptive emotional brain circuits in chronic pain, specifically to fronto-striatal circuits. Such a shift in chronic pain fits the observation of augmented negative affect and impaired motivated behavior, mirrored in anhedonia (i.e. the inability to feel pleasure) and very high comorbidity (up to 86%) between chronic pain and affective disturbances. Based on such observations, chronic pain has been described to induce a negative hedonic shift. Although this suggestion has been cited often and is compelling in explaining the development and maintenance of unspecific chronic pain, the underlying mechanisms of such a shift have not directly been investigated so far. It has been shown that patients with constant chronic back pain have increased activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and in the amygdala, as well as an increased incidence of white matter and increased functional connections between the mPFC, the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and the amygdala compared to recovered patients and healthy controls. Of particular importance, altered fronto-striatal circuits, especially the increased functional connectivity between the NAcc and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), predicts the transition from subacute to chronic pain. Moreover, the importance of the NAcc-vmPFC connectivity for the modulation of pain perception has been confirmed in healthy persons.\n\nThe aims of this study are therefore (1) to illustrate that emotional-motivational components are in-creased relative to sensory-discriminative components in chronic pain, (2) to show that increased emo-tional motivational pain responses in chronic pain can also be decreased by counterconditioning, leading to a normalization of pain perception relative to healthy individuals as well, and (3) to assess the neural correlate of the counterconditioning effects on emotional-motivational pain responses, specifically alterations in functional connectivity yin fronto-striatal networks.\n\nIntended intervention: All participants perform one psychophysical task to assess sensory-discriminative and emotional-motivational pain responses simultaneously. In Substudy 1 an associative learning paradigm will be implemented to dissociating the sensory-discriminative pain responses compared to emotional-motivational pain responses by monetary reinforcement. In Substudy 2, the effects of the counterconditioning on fronto-striatal networks will be assessed by MRI.\n\nPotential for new scientific generalizable knowledge: Our knowledge on the basic mechanisms of pain increased rapidly in recent years. Nevertheless, treatment of chronic pain is surprisingly unsuc-cessful. Particularly, patients suffering from unspecific pain often do not get efficient treatment. This gap between basic knowledge and applied treatment likely is caused by a mismatch between research foci and the subjective complains of patients. Basic research focuses on neurobiological basic mechanisms, e.g. on molecular and neuronal levels. Although indisputable of high relevance for our understanding of pian, it is hard to transfer these basic mechanisms directly to the multifaceted experience of pain in humans, because this can be strongly modulated by emotional and cognitive processes. The goal of this study is to provide a substantial contribution to lose this gap by (1) providing new methods needed for an appropriate investigation of the problem outlined and (2) by gathering new knowledge on pain mechanisms relevant in the development and maintenance of chronic pain.\n\nThis study is a Clinical Study Category A because it includes an intervention that is neither a drug nor a transplant.

With an incidence of 1 in 10,000 and a carrier frequency of 1 in 50, SMA is one of the most common recessive genetic diseases. SMA muscle disease, which has a broad phenotype, is classified according to the age of onset of symptoms and motor milestones achieved. Type 1 SMA is the most common type that starts before 6 months. These babies, who never gain the ability to sit independently, have a severe weakness. It is also one of the most common genetic causes of death in children. Type 2 SMA occurs before 18 months. With milder weakness, these infants can sit but never walk independently. Type 3 SMA patients can ambulate. Type 4 SMA occurs with milder weakness in adults. Providing supportive treatment by a multidisciplinary team is essential for prolonging life and more comfortable life by reducing the severity of symptoms, especially in the most severe SMA cases. However, this is not enough to change the poor prognosis. FDA-approved drugs improve survival and motor function, allowing some SMA patients to reach motor milestones they've never reached before. The positive results of medical and physical treatments are most striking before the onset of the symptoms of weakness in infants.\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive inherited disorder. Mutations in the dystrophin protein cause this progressive muscle disease, which affects one in 5000 male newborns in the world. However, developmentally delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness seen around 2-3 years of age, toe walking, frequent falls, calf hypertrophy, and Gowers Sign are warning signs for diagnosis. The time from the concern of the families to the certain diagnosis of the DMD is approximately 2 years. This delay in diagnosis can be devastating for the family and the patient, as muscle function declines during this time. Although DMD predominantly affects men, a small number of female carriers may present with a variety of symptoms. For this reason, genetic testing is recommended to find out the carrier status of female relatives of patients with DMD. A proactive approach and multidisciplinary teamwork are required in the care of DMD patients. Early diagnosis and timely access to treatment are promising for children with DMD.\n\nIn the light of all this information, the authors emphasize the importance of early newborn diagnosis and genetic carrier screening for these two serious muscle diseases. This study was designed to understand the general awareness of society on these devastating diseases. Furthermore, the attitude of people towards the newborn and genetic carrier screening, and the physiotherapy approach as a treatment method will be questioned during the study.

Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability.

Intravenous catheters (IVs) have been shown to be among the leading causes of pain in hospitalized children 1 and venipucture is commonly seen as one of the most painful and frequently performed invasive procedures by nurses. 2 (Jacobson et al.) Children recording VAS pain scores in response to IV catheter placement in the Emergency Department rated the pain as 3.23/5.0 and their parent rated their children's pain as 3.4/5.0. 3 (Skarbek et al.) The placement of intravenous catheters would be more efficient and less stressful if the clinician had a clear roadmap or picture highlighting the location of the vein. The lack a clear visual guide to IV placement often leads to multiple painful attempts at catheter placement as well as delays urgent in treatment ( I.V. fluid and medication administration) and increased use of human resources. The current average number of catheter punctures needed in order to achieve successful catheter placement is 2.4 with a range of 1-14. 4 ( Larue, GD ) The VeinViewer by Luminetx™ allows the clinician to clearly see the child's accessible vasculature or the lack thereof in real time, directly on the surface of the skin. The clinician can be trained to operate the VeinViewer in minutes and use does not require any additional job or skills certification. The VeinViewer is free standing and hands-free allowing the clinician the freedom to use both hands to carry out the work of placing the catheter (unlike ultrasound which requires one hand to hold the probe and the other hand to place the catheter, unless two people are available and able to coordinate their work efforts thus doubling the resources necessary for I.V. placement. The VeinViewer is non-invasive and causes no tissue damage. There is no patient contact with the device and therefore no risk of infectious disease contamination with blood products. The VeinViewer uses near-infrared light to locate subcutaneous veins and project their location onto the surface of the skin thus creating a visible roadmap for I.V catheter placement. This protocol describes a prospective, randomized, study, evaluating the effectiveness of VeinViewer in increasing the ease of intravenous cannulation in children receiving intravenous cannulation in the pediatric emergency department. The investigators hypothesize that cannulation using VeinViewerâ will require fewer sticks and will result in fewer missed or repeated IV starts, fewer extravasating (\"blown vein\") IV placements, increased perceived ease of placement by the operator, and decreased pain associated with the IV placement as perceived by the child, the parent, and the operator.\n\n2. Background Intravenous cannulation is a routine and common part of treatment for children receiving care in the Pediatric Emergency Department. Intravenous cannulation is painful and often challenging in children. Peripheral IV's are generally placed using visual and/or tactile cues. These may be minimal or deceptive in children who often have small peripheral veins and increased subcutaneous fat with opaque, elastic skin. Health care workers often struggle to place these IV's successfully making multiple sticks, infiltrating subcutaneous tissues, requiring extensive operator time, and, most importantly, causing the patient and the parent distress. A number of approaches have been tried, attempting to decrease the pain of these cannulations. Most of these involve the cutaneous application of lidocaine in an attempt to numb the skin and decrease the pain of the stick.\n\nEMLA and more recently, LMX (lidocaine in liposomal delivery system) are effective topical agents but there is a 30 minute dwell time - inappropriate in the Emergency Medicine setting. A number of devices have been tested which decrease the barrier of the stratum corneum thus allowing the lidocaine to anesthetize the skin in 3-5 minutes. These include a hand held laser (effective but burns and pigments the skin), a small ultrasound (effective but bulky and difficult to use), and gas pressure driven powdered lidocaine (effective but not approved by the FDA yet for general sales and distribution). These devices depend on identifying the vein and then successfully cannulating the identified vein through the anestethized skin. Missed sticks force the operator to begin the anesthesia process all over again in a different site. This process is time consuming and ineffective in the ED setting.\n\nOther centers have begun to employ ultrasound to identify the veins for peripheral cannulation to cannulate under indirect visualization. This process is difficult for small mobile pediatric veins and requires extensive operator training and practice. It also requires an extra set of operator hands when children, often less than cooperative, are involved. It is unclear that this approach will be effective in the Pediatric ED.\n\nVein Viewerâ is a hands off device that projects a map of the subcutaneous veins onto the surface of the skin. It allows the operator to insert the IV catheter under direct visualization. It can be used by one operator who can insert the catheter and restrain the child's arm while using the device. Direct visualization is accurate and decreases the blind sticks, missed \"fishing expeditions\", and extravasations of IV fluid and medication (often not benign) that can occur with IV cannulation, especially in children. Decreasing the number of sticks and the time to successful catheterization will decrease the child's and the parents perceived pain of the procedure and the operator time to effective catheterization thus increasing the efficiency of the operator and the ED in general, and speeding the initiation of therapy (IV hydration or medication). The Vein Viewer has no side effects and is visually interesting to children and parents. It has the potential to revolutionize the effectiveness and efficiency, of IV cannulation in the Pediatric Emergency Department and decrease substantially the child's and the parent's perceived pain from the procedure and fear of the procedure."],"EnrollmentCount":["200"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":334,"NCTId":["NCT03836300"],"OfficialTitle":["Piloting an Early Intervention Program for Infants With Rare Neurogenetic Disorders"],"OverallStatus":["Enrolling by invitation"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["The objective is to develop and test, through an iterative process, an intervention to address and support the development of infants with a confirmed diagnosis of neurogenetic disorders that leave individuals at risk for developmental delays or intellectual and developmental disabilities.

In the United States, most patients are admitted for inpatient therapy; however, there is evidence to suggest that outpatient therapy may be safe in patients with non-massive PEs. Appropriate outpatient treatment of patients with pulmonary emboli not only has the potential to increase patient satisfaction, but also has the potential to significantly reduce cost of care without compromising patient safety.\n\nThe pulmonary embolism severity index (PESI) is an externally validated prediction tool for mortality associated with PE. The PESI consists of 11 clinical parameters that are routinely available and stratifies patients into 5 risk categories, class I having the lowest risk of short-term mortality and class V having the highest. The PESI does not rely on imaging modalities to determine risk of adverse outcome within 30 days of initial PE diagnosis.\n\nPredicting short-term adverse outcomes in PE is essential for proper disposition, namely hospitalization of at-risk patients and discharge of those with low likelihood of decompensation. Hariharan et al. evaluated the ability of PESI to predict short-term deterioration (<5 days) in patients with acute PE. The PESI demonstrated a sensitivity of 86% (95% CI 73-93%) for predicting short-term adverse events. Approximately 14% of patients deemed low-risk by PESI required short-term interventions. The authors concluded that risk stratification with PESI warrants further optimization.\n\nFurther research in South Korea has suggested combining CT findings of right ventricular dysfunction (RVD) with the PESI score improved predictive accuracy. Right heart strain may be an independent prognostic factor of adverse outcomes in patients with acute PE, and may enhance prognosis versus PESI score alone.\n\nPoint-of-care (POC) echocardiography has been shown to be a useful diagnostic tool to detect RVD. Several parameters can provide morphological, functional, and hemodynamic information that are obtainable using a bedside study. These include tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and 60/60 sign.\n\nPOC ultrasound (US) can be performed at the bedside by trained emergency physicians to assess for these markers of RVD. The investigators hypothesize this will yield significant benefit in risk stratifying individuals with acute PE and potentially influence disposition. This study aims to assess the role of US-guided measures of RVD in predicting clinical outcomes in patients with acute PE, both in isolation and in conjunction with PESI scores.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\nTo assess the diagnostic performance of ultrasound-guided measures of RVD, specifically TAPSE and the 60-60 sign, in predicting short term clinical outcomes in acute PE\nTo investigate the diagnostic performance of combining ultrasound-guided measures of RVD (TAPSE and 60-60 sign) and the PESI score in predicting short term adverse outcomes in acute PE\n\nRESEARCH METHODS\n\nStudy Design\n\nThis is an observational, prospective study of patients presenting to the ED and diagnosed with acute PE by CT imaging. Screening for potential subjects will be conducted by ED staff working clinically, as well as ultrasound/procedure emergency medicine residents and US fellows/faculty on \"scanning shifts\". Informed consent will be obtained by a member of the study team prior to data collection or study procedures. A POC ultrasound will be performed by an ED attending, fellow or resident under the supervision of an emergency physician accredited in bedside echocardiography, which is considered standard of care. Data regarding the initial presentation, components of the PESI score and POC ultrasound will be documented at the bedside. Ultrasound images will be recorded via the usual ultrasound archival software and undergo the standard QA process. ED residents/fellows/attendings participating in this study will be trained on study protocols by accredited staff prior to participation in consent, ultrasonography and data collection.\n\nPatients enrolled in the study will receive telephone follow-up calls from the research team at 7 (+/- 3) and 30 (+/- 5) days from the date of PE diagnosis. Questions will focus on subsequent adverse outcomes, including development of recurrent PE/DVT, new cardiac dysrhythmia, advanced cardiac life support, advanced respiratory support, need for pressor support, need for thrombolysis, development of major bleeding, return to the ED, or death.\n\nAdditional follow up data will be collected via review of the electronic medical record and documented on a standardized data collection form after 30 days from initial diagnosis.\n\nStudy Population and Recruitment Methods\n\nStudy population will include ED patients over the age of 18 who are identified as have an acute pulmonary embolism on CT imaging. Patients will be seen initially by the treating physician and receive the usual standard of care. If an acute PE is identified, the treating physician will contact a member of the study team to assess eligibility, discuss the study with the patient and obtain consent. The POC ultrasound may be performed by a physician member of the study team or another credentialed emergency physician.\n\nRole of Subjects\n\nThe study subjects will receive standard treatment at the discretion of the treating physician and resident team. The patient's decision to participate in this study will not directly affect their care in the ED. The treating physician and resident team will not necessarily be blinded to the findings of the POC US as this may yield important clinical information.\n\nResearch Procedures\n\nScreening for inclusion in this study will occur in the Emergency Department as outlined above. Informed consent will be given to eligible patients for review. Written informed consent will be obtained prior to ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound images will be saved and stored securely on the hospital server. Ultrasonographic findings and initial clinical data will be recorded on a Bedside Standardized Data Collection Form during the exam. Follow up clinical information from chart review and telephone calls will be recorded on a Follow Up Standardized Data Collection Form.\n\nEach patient will be assigned a study ID number at the time of enrollment and a linking document will be maintained. Once data collection is complete, forms will be de-identified by the removal of the patient's name/MRN/FIN/identifying information.\n\nUltrasound Technique\n\nAll POC echocardiograms will be obtained utilizing 2.5-3.5 MHz transducers by a credentialed physician sonographer during initial evaluation in the ED. Patients will be examined in the supine or left lateral decubitus position.\n\nTAPSE serves as a quantitative measure of right heart dysfunction. TAPSE will be calculated by obtaining a standard apical four chamber view with M-mode placed over the lateral tricuspid annulus to measure the maximal excursion of the RV between the end of diastole to the end of systole. Patients will be divided into high risk, moderate risk, and low risk groups based on TAPSE measurements of <16 mm, 16-20 mm, and >20 mm respectively.\n\n60/60 sign is defined as both a pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) of <60 mmHg and pulmonary acceleration time (PAT) of <60 msecs. In patients without chronic right heart remodeling, PASP can be estimated using right ventricular systolic pressures (RVSP). RVSP calculation relies on both estimating the tricuspid gradient (TG) and the right atrial pressure (RAP). Right atrial pressure in non-ventilated patients can be approximated using central venous pressure. By placing the ultrasound probe in sagittal axis subxiphoid view, the IVC size can be measured at 2 cm distal to the right atrium. A plethoric IVC with a large diameter of >2.1 cm with <50% collapse with respiration estimates a RAP of 15 mmHg, which is considered elevated. A diameter of >2.1 cm with >50% collapse or a diameter of <2.1 cm with <50% collapse estimates a RAP of 8 mmHg, which is considered normal. A narrow IVC with a diameter of <2.1 cm and >50% collapse with respiratory variation estimates a RAP of 3 mmHg. (10) TG is measured using tricuspid regurgitation jet. While using standard apical 4 chamber view, color flow will be applied across the tricuspid valve to identify regurgitation jet. Continuous wave doppler will be applied in the middle of the jet. Peak blood flow (TRmax) will be measured at the apex of the waveform.\n\nTG will then be calculated using the equation:\n\nTG = 4 x (TRmax) 2\n\nRVSP will be calculated using the equation:\n\nRVSP = TG + RAP\n\nAn RVSP of <60 mmHg suggests acute RV dysfunction whereas an RVSP of >60 mmHg suggests chronic RV dysfunction.\n\nPAT refers to the amount of time it takes to reach peak pulmonic velocity. PAT will be calculated using the basal short axis view with power Doppler aligned with blood flow through the pulmonic valve with sweep speed increased to measure the time between the initial blood flow to peak blood flow. A PAT of <60 msecs indicates that the pulmonic velocity and pressure peak very quickly, suggesting an acute cause of RV dysfunction. (4, 10)\n\nData Analysis/Sample Size Calculations\n\nDescriptive statistics will be reported as means/medians with standard deviations/interquartile ranges for continuous variables and proportions with percentages for categorical variables. The diagnostic performance of PESI score, POC echocardiography and the combination of PESI+POC echocardiography for predicting the primary and secondary outcomes will be calculated, including sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and negative/positive predictive values (NPV/PPV) with associated 95% confidence intervals. Interrater reliability for follow up data collection from the medical record will be assessed via Cohen's Kappa. p<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\nThe investigators anticipate approximately 30% of the enrolled acute PE population will experience at least one component of the primary composite outcome. Setting a goal sensitivity of 95% (+/- 5%) for the combined PESI+POC echocardiography prediction tool, assuming alpha=0.05, beta=0.2 and allowing for an approximated 10% attrition rate, the investigators estimate that 250 patients will be required to achieve adequate statistical power.\n\nRisks and Risk Management\n\nThere are minimal risks to patients participating in this study since ultrasound is non-invasive and known to be safe. There is a slight risk of the participants' privacy or confidentiality being breached. Standard precautions will be taken to ensure privacy and confidentiality is maintained during the study.\n\nBenefits\n\nSubjects may receive clinical benefit from the additional information provided by POC echocardiography; however, the disposition and treatment of patients enrolled in this study will remain at the discretion of the primary attending and resident team. The results of the ultrasound study will be made available to the clinical team.\n\nAlternative Procedures\n\nPatients who decline to participate in the study will not have the quality of their treatment affected in any way.\n\nResearch materials, records, confidentiality\n\nResearch records will be stored in locked offices, filing cabinets, and computers using passwords.\n\nSubject informed consent\n\nWe will seek documented informed consent and HIPAA Authorization. Patients who decline participation will continue their usual treatment course in the ED."],"EnrollmentCount":["250"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":339,"NCTId":["NCT04345731"],"OfficialTitle":["Over-the-counter (OTC) Labels for Older Adults"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Optimizing OTC labels for older adults: Empirical evaluation of labels designed to provide older users the information they need to to minimize adverse drug events"],"CollaboratorName":["University of Wisconsin, Madison"],"StartDate":["July 16, 2018"],"CompletionDate":["July 16, 2023"],"DetailedDescription":["The overarching goal is to design and evaluate a novel front of pack label for OTC drugs that will reduce the prevalence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) in older adults.

Consequently they do not have the strength to generate the minimum flow of 160 to 300 liters/minute for an efficient cough function.

The patient's susceptibility to infection increases again and the vicious circle repeats itself. Severe secretion retention may even lead to ventilator failure.

Following the earliest possible, low-threshold identification of post-/long-COVID sufferers, an intensive multidisciplinary assessment is conducted, resulting in holistic treatment planning based on the results of the assessment. This consists of recommendations for a coordinated, interdisciplinary therapy plan. At the same time, digital therapy offers are recommended and made available to patients. Patients are accompanied by a supporting counselor who guides them through the entire care process. This closes the gap between acute care of COVID-19 and outpatient therapy or rehabilitation of post-/long-COVID.\n\nTo identify patients with post-/long-COVID symptoms, a low-threshold scientifically based screening that confirms the presence of post-/long-COVID syndrome and an three day inpatient assessment that determines the need for further treatment will be developed, validated and prepared for standard care. Long-term goals are the dissemination of the validated instruments and treatment approaches (interdisciplinary, individualized treatment plan) through communication to key stakeholders such as medical associations, health insurance companies, service providers in the outpatient and inpatient sector, as well as professional societies and care institutions. This is intended to improve patient care and make care delivery of treatments for post-/long-COVID patients more efficient beyond the project duration.\n\nStandard care currently diagnoses post-/long-COVID-19 syndrome and provides recommendations for treatment through primary care practices and specialized post-COVID outpatient clinics. Both access routes inadequately reach young people and those affected in rural areas. Post-COVID outpatient clinics are primarily located in metropolitan areas and are therefore mainly available to the population in large cities. In particular, young affected individuals who have had little to no prior outpatient care due to a very mild course do not have primary care and often do not have the knowledge of the specific post-/long-COVID symptomatology and potentially seek insufficient and delayed medical support. This may result in aggravation and possibly chronification of symptoms and consequent long-term disability/ incapacity with limited participation. This in turn can have a negative impact on the continuation or resumption of work and lead to economic burdens for the whole society.\n\nThe contents of the present project include, as an innovative basis outside the existing standard care, the low-threshold identification of affected persons, an intensive interdisciplinary assessment resulting in a comprehensive, interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral treatment plan, the implementation of which is controlled and accompanied by a personal supporting counselor and augmented by continuously available training in the form of digital offers.\n\nThe following research questions and hypotheses will be investigated with this project and subsequently communicated to the various stakeholders and the general public:\n\nWhat screening tool can reliably identify patients suffering from post/long-COVID syndrome? Hypothesis: With a simplified screening, the presence of post/long-COVID can be identified in a low-threshold manner.\nWhich assessments can be used to reliably determine the need for therapy or rehabilitation and the leading rehabilitation indication? Hypothesis: With a comprehensive assessment, the need for rehabilitation and the leading rehabilitation indication can be determined validly and reliably.\nWhat must digital therapy offerings look like to benefit patients with post/long-COVID syndrome? Hypothesis: Digital therapy offerings with an individualizable focus achieve the best success in the treatment of post/long-COVID.\nWhat information must the supporting counselor have to ensure management of interdisciplinary treatment? Hypothesis: As a point of contact for all stakeholders, a supporting counselor will have interdisciplinary and intersectoral treatment planning available to ensure sustained management of interdisciplinary treatment.\nHow should an interdisciplinary treatment pathway look like in the long term? Hypothesis: An interdisciplinary treatment pathway must guide the patient, with the support of the supporting counselor, in such a way that he or she experiences the appropriate diagnosis and treatment for him or herself and actively participates in recovery so that he or she recovers quickly and sustainably from his or her post/long-COVID disease, increases his or her functional capacity, reduces incapacity to work, and regains participation.\n\nThe project aims to optimize care for post/long-COVID patients and empower them to participate. Affected individuals are supported on their way to the appropriate therapeutic and rehabilitative care by expert staff, the supporting counselor s, and receive interdisciplinary multi-professional treatment focused on individual complaints. Affected individuals are accompanied and supported through digital therapies. The low-threshold access leads to the elimination of information loss and inhibitions. Various digital services, such as DiGAs, video consultations, as well as aftercare services are increasingly used.

The protocol consisted of two visits. A pre-experimental visit and a study visit.\n\nPre-experimental visit. Total muscle mass presented as lean body mass (LBM) was measured by DEXA scan. Furthermore, pre-experimental preparations included that all subjects were instructed to follow national nutritional recommendations with a healthy diet consisting of less than 30% fat, low fat protein, long chain carbohydrates and minimize sugar intake three days before the study.\n\nStudy visit. Patients were admitted to the hospital at 16:00 hours for IV catheter placement and a standardized evening meal at 17:00. Two venous catheters were inserted, one in the cubital vein (for stable-isotope infusion) and one in the distal cephalic vein (for blood sampling). A heating pad, covering the hand and distal forearm, ensured shunting of arterial blood to the veins in order to obtain arterialized blood.

In literature of the last decade we find evidence of social and personal benefits deriving from the use of assistive mechanical arms in daily life activities by patients with disabilities due to neuromuscular diseases. The results indicate improved quality of life, greater self-esteem and greater integration into society. In addition to the benefits for the person, it has been shown that the introduction of assistive technologies in the life of patients can lead to potential savings on direct and indirect costs of National Health Services. Assistive robotic arms have a potential user base of approximately 150,000 people only in the United States of America. This population includes subjects who have partially lost the function of the upper limb due to degenerative diseases or because of spinal cord injuries or infantile cerebral palsy. The number of potential users could increase by improving the usability of these systems that, at the moment, still require a certain functionality of the upper limb, in general, and of the hand, in particular. It is in fact known that the introduction of assistive technologies in daily life is not limited so much by the fact that patients do not accept or profit from them, but rather by the actual possibility of using them effectively. Therefore, a customization of the functionality of the devices based on needs and wishes of the patients alongside an improvement in their usability would lead to an increase in potential users. It is for this reason that usability, together with safety, has become one of the most studied topics in assistive robotics. In the case of assistive robotic manipulators, usability problems often concern their control which, even today, takes place through the use of joysticks that require fine motor skills in the hand. In fact, being systems with multiple degrees of freedom, that is, equipped with different segments that can translate (or rotate) in different directions, different buttons are integrated in the control joysticks in addition to the classic lever with knob.

Most of the burden of diarrheal disease is thought to be preventable with improvements in sanitation, water quality, and hygiene. Large scale interventions promoting these behaviours have either not been rigorously tested or have not produced sufficient change to warrant being rolled out at scale.\n\nResearch into the determinants of hand washing behaviour has identified disgust and shame as key motivators. Evidence supports the theory that disgust is a natural behavioural reaction to objects carrying disease risk, thus it may act as a key motivator for other health related behaviours such as water treatment. Whether this knowledge can be harnessed to increase the efficacy of hand washing and safe water campaigns in Bangladesh or elsewhere has yet to be rigorously tested.\n\nThe investigators will develop an intervention that utilizes disgust and shame eliciting messages to promote hand washing with soap and point of use water treatment in low income housing compounds of urban Dhaka. The investigators will test the efficacy of this intervention against a more traditional public health intervention based on increasing knowledge of health risks and germ transmission using a randomized controlled trial. The study sample will be broken into the following four arms.\n\nStandard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment\nStandard Public Health Intervention with Water Treatment & Hand Washing\nDisgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment\nDisgust and Shame Based Intervention with Water Treatment & Hand\n\nThis design will allow us to compare outcomes for hand washing and water treatment between both standard public health interventions and disgust and shame based interventions as well as test the overall efficacy of the program comparing with the control. Data will be collected from all compounds at baseline, three month midline and at the six month endline giving us the practical and analytical benefits of a longitudinal dataset.\n\nCompounds will participate in interactive, educational safe water and/or hygiene promotion meetings. For the Disgust and Shame group, these meetings will emphasize disgust and shame related to unsafe water and/or hygiene practices, whereas the Standard group's meetings will resemble a more typical public health intervention explaining the risks and methods of contamination.\n\nAt the first meeting, compounds will receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based chlorine dispenser model to treat their drinking water. A randomly selected half will also receive a one month free trial of the latest compound based handwashing station. At the end of the month, there will be a sales meeting in which the investigators will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction.\n\nIn assessing the impact of the interventions, the investigators are primarily interested in whether the prevalences of safe water and hygiene behaviours differ by treatment arm and over time. The best measurements for approximating behaviour prevalence are physical observations (presence of residual chlorine, hand cleanliness inspections), structured observation of behaviour, rapid physical observations (physical state of hardware/drinking water), self-report of water treatment and hand washing behaviour and willingness to pay for necessary products. The investigators will also attempt to measure and track changes in personal determinants of behaviour such as feelings of disgust and shame related to hand washing and water treatment behaviours."],"CollaboratorName":["University of California, Berkeley","University of Maryland","Harvard University"],"StartDate":["August 2011"],"CompletionDate":["June 2014"],"DetailedDescription":["Study Design To rigorously test the main study hypotheses the investigators are using a stratified, cluster randomized trial.

The Qualitative team will use focus group discussions and in depth interviews as primary tools to assess field tests.\n\nAim Four To develop a survey instrument which allows us to measure behavioural determinants of hand washing and water treatment, the investigators will perform multiple pilots and revisions of our questionnaire on small sample groups similar to our sample. Revisions will be made based on qualitative review of subjects' impressions and a quantitative review of gathered data. In the quantitative review the investigators will perform principal components analysis and factor analysis of data to refine scales for behavioural determinants already defined and/or to investigate whether there are other determinants worth measuring.\n\nAim Five The investigators have a short list of new measurement ideas that the investigators will field test and review prior to implementation. For more details on this list, see the \"Data Collection\" section below.\n\nImplementation\n\nVisit 1: Sample Enrollment, Baseline Data Collection and Set-up of Promotion Meeting\n\nWithin the chosen field sites, FRAs will search for compounds which, match all the essential criteria (see below), match at least 2 of the preferred criteria (see below) and which are located at least 75 footsteps apart from each other. Our field team will make several visits during the six months of the study to each of the enrolled compounds. During each of these visits the investigators will conduct different activities including a household survey, structured observation, and physical observations. The investigators will ask for consent from all the compound members verbally during a courtyard meeting, and ask the members to come to a consensus of who can sign as the compound head or manager. In the written consent form all the study activities have been described briefly to make it simple and easy to administer and understand. For each specific activity the investigators will again ask for an individual's verbal consent, which will serve as a reminder that individuals are still willing to take part in the activity. Taking written consent for each activity during each visit could make the visit even longer. Signing paper documents several times could make the participants confused and concerned because most of them cannot t read or write. For any household members who miss the first courtyard meeting, the investigators will repeat all the information and process.\n\nIf they do not agree, then FRAs will move to the next suitable compound. If they agree and sign the form, then FRAs will record stratification data and perform baseline data collection which consists of two household questionnaires and six household physical observation forms (see \"Data Collection\" below for more details on questionnaire and physical observation). Later, FROs will use stratification data to determine the stratum and randomly assign the treatment arm for each compound.\n\nHousehold representatives who will participate in baseline data collection will be randomly selected from the pool of compound members present at visit 1. To ensure random selection, the FRA will first arbitrarily assign numbers to the households with members present. He/she will then write the numbers on small plastic balls and drop the balls into a cup. He/she will then shake the cup and pour out one ball. The number on the ball corresponds to the first household to approach for data collection. The FRA will ask the present members of the household who is responsible for collecting water. This person will be asked to participate, if he/she declines, the FRA will pour another ball out of the cup and repeat the procedure. These steps will be repeated until six consenting compounds have been selected. The first two will be given the questionnaire and physical observation form and the last four, only the physical observation.\n\nEssential compound criteria\n\nBetween 3 and 15 House'holds\nShared water source\nPhysical space exists to hold a compound meeting here or nearby\nNo other interventions going on at this time\nPopulation is all Bangali\n\nPreferred criteria\n\nUse of water source is visible to others\nShared kitchen\nShared toilets visible from common area Visit 2: First Meeting- Promotion and Free Trial FISs will conduct a three hour integrated behaviour change/product promotion program taking place in the compound or at a convenient meeting place nearby. The content of the program, which will vary by treatment arm, will be developed during piloting and is briefly described below under \"Meeting Content and Hardware\".\n\nAt the end of the program, compounds will be offered a one month free trial of the hardware specific to their study arm (see \"Meeting Content and Hardware\").\n\nVisit 3: Reminder Visit Roughly two weeks after the first meeting compounds will receive a check-up and reminder visit. FISs will meet with available individuals in two smaller groups. The FIS will reiterate messages from the first meeting and discuss understanding and agreement with these messages in order to further understanding and reduce perceived barriers to the new behaviours.\n\nVisit 4: Setup of Second Meeting and BDM Auction Coaching Roughly three weeks after the first meeting, FISs will visit compounds to set up a time and date for the second compound meeting and to prepare the compound members for the auction. FISs will meet with groups of two to four prospective bidders for an hour each and will explain in detail the process and hold multiple mock auctions.\n\nVisit 5: Second Meeting- Promotion and Sales Roughly one month after the first meeting, as the free trial is ending, FISs will return to treatment compounds to conduct the promotion and sales meetings.\n\nThe promotion segment will be a one and a half hour behaviour change/product promotion program similar to the first meeting but containing fresh material.\n\nIn the second one and a half hour segment of the meeting, FISs will measure compound members' willingness to pay for the trialled products by giving them the opportunity purchase and keep the hardware in a Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) style auction. Compounds not willing to pay the offered price will be offered other options to keep the hardware assuring that at least 75% of compounds keep the products until endline (more details on this in Auction section below).\n\nFee Collection Visits Every month for a year after the sales meeting, compounds will be visited by an FA who will collect fees and take rapid observation data (detailed under \"Data Collection\" below).\n\nVisit 6: Midline Data Collection Three months after baseline data collection, FRAs will return to compounds to collect midline data which consists of two household questionnaires and six household physical observation forms (see \"Data Collection\" below for more details on questionnaire and physical observation). FRAs will attempt to use the same households as before, but if they are not present after returning to the compound for a second attempt, then FRAs will use the randomization strategy from the first visit to select new households.\n\nVisit 7: Structured Observation Half way between midline and endline data collection a separate team of FRAs will perform 5 hour structured observations of hand washing and water treatment behaviour in a representative subgroup of our sample. More on this under \"Data Collection\" below.\n\nVisit 8: Endline Data Collection Six months after baseline data collection, FRAs will return to compounds to collect endline data which consists of two household questionnaires and six household physical observation forms (see \"Data Collection\" below for more details on questionnaire and physical observation). FRAs will attempt to use the same households as before, but if they are not present after returning to the compound for a second attempt, then FRAs will use the randomization strategy from the first visit to select new households.\n\nMeeting Content and Hardware:\n\nHardware Water Treatment One wall mounted liquid chlorine dispenser One 40 liter reservoir with tap Hand Washing One reused 1.5 liter water bottle to be filled with soapy water (laundry detergent mixed with water)\n\nMeeting Content\n\nAll compounds:\n\nAll will receive water treatment promotion interventions, whether standard or disgust and shame based. Two thirds will be randomly selected to receive hand washing promotion along with water treatment.\n\nStandard Public Health Intervention:\n\nThe standard public health intervention meetings will be modeled after typical pre-existing high quality water treatment and/or hand washing interventions. The content will include explaining/demonstrating how germs can enter into our body via untreated water and/or unwashed hands, how they can make us sick and lead to death, and how these risks can be reduced by practicing safe water and/or hand hygiene behaviour.\n\nDisgust and Shame Based Intervention:\n\nThe disgust and shame meetings will contain similar explanations/demonstrations of contamination mechanisms and risk, but will place most emphasis on the presence of fecal matter in or on contaminated objects. FIS' will use more vivid or harsh local terms equivalent to \"crap\" or \"shit\" to try to elicit a stronger reaction from participants. They will try to communicate the information that we sometimes unknowingly serve feces to our family by not washing hands with soap or by not treating our drinking water. They will emphasize how fecal matter can spread between people, especially neighbours, to try to encourage people to care about others behaviours and what others think of their behaviours. Pending piloting, the meetings will also contain promotion of positive identities-being a good mother, a strong father or a good Muslim-to stand in contrast with shameful and disgusting activities. The content and terms used will be determined by qualitative investigation with community members.\n\nData Collection Questionnaire All compounds will be surveyed at baseline, a three month midline and a six month endline. The questionnaire for each of these instances will be largely the same excepting corrections made during implementation and small changes for administering at different times. The questionnaire will measure self-reported usage, reports of neighbours' usage, knowledge and practice pertaining to hand washing and safe water, perceptions of risk and severity of diarrhoea, norms/ beliefs/ feelings/ reactions relating disgust and shame, social networking, and demographic information. These measurements will allow us to study the differences in behaviour and of behavioral determinants over time and between groups.\n\nPhysical Observation One of each of the following is taken in 6 households per compound each time the questionnaire is administered and also during the structured observation.\n\nChlorine residual testing of stored drinking water (not taken at baseline) Hand cleanliness inspections of child (see scoring sheet in appendix 4) Hand washing demonstration by mother The investigators will ask her to demonstrate how she washes her hands after defecation. The investigators will evaluate her performance as outlined in appendix 4.\n\nOthers the investigators may include pending piloting:\n\nHand rinse water testing via H2S testing (see appendix 13 for previous principle and interpretation) Other finger cleanliness checks Wiping fingers on a white material and evaluating darkness Wiping fingers on oil blotter paper Drinking water quality testing via H2S testing\n\nRapid Physical Observation Rapid observations will take place in all compound visits and consist of identifying the location and usability/usage status of hand washing and water treatment hardware.\n\nStructured observation There will be one structured observation visit halfway between the midline and endline data collection visit. FRAs will conduct 5 hour structured observations of hand washing and water treatment behaviours in a sub-group of compounds which is representative of our sample. Hand hygiene and water treatment behaviours will be assessed using the score sheet in appendix 6.\n\nAuction/Willingness to Pay After the courtyard meeting, the investigators will conduct an experimental auction to elicit individual households willingness to pay (WTP)for a monthly rent-to-own subscription to the chlorine dispenser and the reservoir. The investigators will use Becker-DeGroot-Marschek (BDM) procedure to elicit WTP, whereby participants bid against a predetermined randomly assigned price confidentially kept in an envelope. The investigators will collect individual bids and list them to find the lowest of these bids, which will then be compared with the price in the envelope. In this auction, if the lowest of participants bid exceeds the preassigned price, participants as a group win the auction but each pay the price in the envelope. The investigators assume the mechanism is incentive compatible for participants to bid truthfully as their bid does not affect the transaction price. The investigators aim to keep the actual sales price very low so that most compounds have the opportunity to keep the dispenser.\n\nPayment data After the sales meeting the investigators will measure continued enrollment and maintenance of the safe water (or safe water and hand-washing) station on a monthly basis.\n\nQualitative Data Collection:\n\nDuring implementation our qualitative team will regularly visit a representative sub-group of our sample to gather data on how the intervention is going, how it is perceived and to give us an idea of what needs to be changed in our meetings or our survey. The standards the investigators are using to determine the frequency of qualitative work are as follows: Roughly one in every five compounds will participate in in-depth interviews and one in every 18 compounds will take place in focused group discussions.

For subjects with lesions in the infrapopliteal arteries, which includes lesions in the mid to distal popliteal artery and below, a smaller profile balloon is necessary. Typically, lesions in the SFA and proximal popliteal arteries are treated by larger diameter balloons and larger sized guidewires (most commonly 0.018\" or 0.035\") which are too large for vessels below-the-knee. For this reason, the Stellarex™ 0.014\" OTW Drug-coated Angioplasty Balloon was developed as a line extension to the Stellarex™ 0.035\" device in order to accommodate the treatment of these smaller vessels. The Stellarex™ 0.014\" balloon has the same drug concentration and is manufactured using a similar method as the Stellarex™ 0.035\" device. Additionally, the Stellarex™ 0.035\" and 0.014\" balloon share a common balloon diameter of 4 mm, a size which was used to treat lesions throughout the popliteal artery in the previous Stellarex 0.035\" studies. For the reasons noted above, equivalence between the two devices has been demonstrated. Furthermore, it is believed that the 0.014\" device will not demonstrate any performance differences nor change the anticipated or residual risks.\n\nIn conclusion, the current study has been developed in agreement with post-market requirements as per the Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF) plan.

Efficacy of a Multicomponent Positive Psychological Intervention Conducted in an Online Large-group One-session Format"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Current models suggest that mental health is not the mere absence of a mental disorder. Rather, mental health consists of two factors, mental disorder symptoms and positive mental health, that can be regarded as continua. Programmes applying interventions known from the positive psychology or positive psychotherapy framework have been shown to enhance psychological wellbeing, subjective wellbeing and to reduce depressive symptoms. However, interventions were mostly conducted in an individual or small group setting and usually consisted of more than one session. The few trainings of minimal length that were conducted in group settings only used one intervention strategy or one part of multicomponent positive psychological interventions. Therefore, the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of short group-interventions are limited. In this study, the investigators plan to conduct an online large-group one-session training to enhance positive mental health that comprises multiple positive psychological interventions (e.g. character strengths, positive communication, goal attainment, etc). Furthermore, an active as well as a passive (waitlist) control group are included in the study. In the active control group, dysfunctional thoughts are adressed that are known to everybody but exist in a great measure in people suffering from depressive disorders. Methods used in cognitive therapy are applied in this group. Participants will be recruited from a community sample without any inclusion criteria but being of legal age. The only exclusion criterion is not having the appropriate technical equipment for participation in a videoconference. Positive mental health as well as other constructs of mental health will be assessed before and after training and at one month and six months follow up to investigate long-term effects of the intervention."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["January 1, 2021"],"CompletionDate":["October 17, 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["In general, the investigators expect an increase in positive mental health in the multicomponent positive psychological intervention (MPPI) group. This effect should be present at the assessment points one month and six months after training. Furthermore, the increase in positive mental health in the MPPI group is expected to be larger than in the two control groups (cognitive intervention targeting dysfunctional thoughts [CIDT], waitlist). Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize participants to benefit from the MPPI in terms of other constructs related to mental health, i.e. self efficacy, happiness, wellbeing, positive emotions, and life satisfaction, in the long term. This increase is expected to be larger in the MPPI than in the two control groups. A decrease in depressive symptoms is hypothesized to occur in the MPPI as well as in the CIDT group.\n\nThe sample under investigation will be a community sample. All participants can attain the training for free and there is no payment for participation. One week before the first training day, the random allocation to the three groups will take place. Two days before the first training day, all participants are asked to fill out another survey through a link sent to them via e-mail. This survey comprises all outcome measures. The same procedure is carried out one day after, one month after and six months after the first training day. After the last assessment time point, the training for the waitlist control group will be conducted.\n\nThe target sample size is 300 participants (100 per group). The investigators will attempt to recruit more participants, assuming that not all will complete the study, especially the assessment after six months.\n\nThe investigators used the software program G*Power to conduct a power analysis. The goal was to obtain .95 power to detect a small effect size of .1 at the standard .05 alpha error probability. The investigators extended the calculated sample size of 264 participants to a target sample size of 300 participants as there was no study before that compared an online multicomponent large-group one-session training to enhance positive mental health with an online large-group one-session intervention targeting dysfunctional thoughts.

Before these analyses are carried out, correlations among the outcome measures are calculated. If outcome measures correlate significantly high (above .5), they will be first analyzed together in a between-within repeated measures MANOVA to control for alpha-error accumulation. After that, the separate analyses will be conducted. Furthermore, there will be paired comparisons between each of the three groups, reducing the first between-subjects factor in the between-within rm(M)ANOVA to two levels.

It is estimated that about 12,500 newborns each year in the United States are identified with one of the conditions screened in NBS, with each child receiving the benefit of early treatment. For inclusion in newborn screening there must be evidence that pre-symptomatic treatment is more effective than treatment after clinical presentation. Most conditions proposed for newborn screening are rare, however, and researchers have difficulty identifying sufficient numbers of babies to test the benefits of pre-symptomatic identification and treatment. This lack of data is central to challenges that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) faces when making federal recommendations to states on which conditions should be included in newborn screening programs. ACHDNC is often asked to consider conditions for inclusion in newborn screening for which there is limited evidence of the natural history, prevalence, and especially about the benefit of early treatment.\n\n\"Rationale\" That evidence gap, especially in the rare disease context, makes it important to develop and test a system to efficiently generate high-quality data about conditions that have the potential to be candidates for state newborn screening. The Early Check program will address this gap through screening newborns for a carefully selected panel of conditions, offered under a research protocol with biological maternal permission, except in cases where there is a transfer or loss of custody. In cases with a transfer/loss of custody, a legal guardian can grant permission for the infant to join Early Check. Early Check will identify pre-symptomatic infants with rare disorders, accelerate the acquisition of data on the early natural history of rare disorders, and demonstrate the feasibility of a statewide program to offer voluntary opt-in newborn screening for a panel of conditions not currently included in states' standard newborn screening. Further, Early Check will facilitate the public health 'on-boarding' of conditions that are ultimately recommended for state newborn screening programs.\n\nThe initial panel of conditions screened in the Early Check program will change over the course of the study.Previously screened conditions have included spinal muscular dystrophy (SMA) and fragile X syndrome (FXS). SMA has an approved treatment, nusinersen, which has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in infants with infantile-onset SMA. In addition, infants with a shorter disease duration compared to a longer disease duration had improved outcomes after the start of treatment with nusinersen, suggesting that earlier identification of SMA would benefit affected infants. There is also an approved gene therapy, Zolgensma, for SMA. FXS does not have an approved treatment, although there is evidence that early behavioral intervention services may improve outcomes. Given that the diagnosis of FXS is made on average after the child is three years old, early identification through the screening of newborns may provide benefit to the child. These conditions are rare; SMA has an estimated incidence of 1 in ~10,000, DMD has an estimated incidence of 1 in 4000-5000 males, and FXS has an estimated incidence of 1 in ~4,000 males and 1 in ~4,000-6,000 females. We also completed a sub-study with a secondary permission process that offers mothers the choice to obtain additional data about the gene that causes FXS: specifically, whether the infant has a premutation in the gene, which has an uncertain impact on the infant's learning and development. This uncertainty is the reason why premutation results are offered separately under a sub-study.\n\nThe current screening panel includes Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and related neuromuscular conditions that result in increased levels of creatine kinase (CK-MM). DMD causes progressive inflammation, fibrosis, and muscle fiber degradation, and weakness. DMD has traditionally been treated with physical therapy, corticosteroids, and ACE inhibitors to delay the progression of skeletal muscle and cardiac damage. In 2016, the FDA approved Eteplirsen (Exondys, 51) a promising treatment for a subset of patients with DMD. In 2017 the FDA approved Emflaza, a corticosteroid also known as deflazacort. In 2019 the FDA approved Vyondys 53 and in 2020 the FDA approved Viltepso for mutations amenable to exon 53 skipping. Early diagnosis allows for treatments that might work best if used presymptomatically.\n\nFor a wide range of rare disorders there is evidence that a delayed diagnosis (i.e., the frequently-described diagnostic odyssey as parents search for a diagnosis) can have negative health outcomes on children who miss out on treatments or interventions and on families who experience negative psychosocial impact\n\nIn the future, Early Check will continue to integrate new conditions to the screening platform as science advances and funding is secured, and conditions may be removed from the screening platform as associated research questions are answered and/or conditions achieve inclusion in state newborn screening programs (as was the case with SMA and FXS).\n\nThe overall research question is whether Early Check is an effective onboarding program to inform newborn screening policy decision-making.\n\nEarly Check will also provide the infrastructure to facilitate translational research studies and clinical trials. A dilemma in research in rare diseases is a lack of sufficient numbers of presymptomatic patients. New treatments are being developed for rare diseases at a rapid pace. Presymptomatic treatment often has the best potential for effective treatment. Currently, early identification and intervention is based on the prenatal or early diagnosis of a sibling of a patient with known disease, which greatly limits the numbers of presymptomatic patients available for trials. Newborn screening has the greatest potential to identify presymptomatic infants. Ultimately the research program should more rapidly advance understanding of diseases and treatments, reducing the length of time for appropriate conditions to be added to the recommended panel for inclusion in state newborn screening programs, and provide early identification of affected newborns.\n\nOverall, this project will provide important information about the success of Early Check to feasibly and acceptably implement a large scale, electronically-mediated research approach to accurately identify affected infants. Results of the research activities and the ongoing quality assessment will be used to inform the most efficient and judicious translation of expanded newborn screening into public health in ways that maximize benefit and minimize potential risk of harm to children and families."],"EnrollmentCount":["20000"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":370,"NCTId":["NCT02121418"],"OfficialTitle":["Decitabine Plus Cytarabine for Induction of Remission in Newly Diagnosed Elderly Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["This clinical trial studies decitabine and cytarabine in treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome that is likely to come back or spread to other places in the body, or myeloproliferative neoplasm.

Language training by telemedicine could improve this situation, and this study seeks to answer the question whether aphasia rehabilitation delivered by videoconference can improve language function in aphasia post stroke."],"CollaboratorName":["South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority"],"StartDate":["May 3, 2016"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2018"],"DetailedDescription":["BACKGROUND:\n\nAbout 25 % of all stroke cases lead to aphasia. Aphasia can include difficulties with speech production and comprehension, as well as reading and writing impairment. Language impairment affects post stroke rehabilitation in a negative manner. Quality of life is reduced in persons with aphasia compared to stroke victims without aphasia. Speech and language therapy is the main form of aphasia rehabilitation. The most updated Cochrane review indicates that intensive speech and language therapy is more effective than therapy of lower intensity. Current aphasia services in Norway do not seem to be in accordance with the national guidelines for treatment and rehabilitation of stroke. The capacity for aphasia rehabilitation at the community level is too small and there is a lack of speech -language pathologists (SLPs). Language training by videoconference could improve this unmet need for language training in post stroke aphasia. The literature within this field is however sparse and there is a substantial lack of studies showing the effectiveness of telerehabilitation. Financed by the Norwegian Foundation for Health and Rehabilitation, the investigators have earlier performed a feasibility study at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital in cooperation with the Norwegian Centre for Integrated Care and Telemedicine. This feasibility study showed that language training by videoconference is feasible with regard to technical, practical and rehabilitation aspects. The feasibility study laid ground for a larger and controlled study.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\n\nThe project aims at contributing with scientific evidence to the field of aphasia telerehabilitation. The objective of this randomized controlled clinical trial is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of speech and language training given by videoconference.\n\nDESIGN:\n\nThe study will be conducted as a pragmatic exploratory randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) with an intervention and a control group. The patients will be assessed at inclusion and before randomization (baseline), and at 4 weeks and 4 months post randomization. Testing is blinded.\n\nPARTICIPANTS:\n\nPatients will be recruited from the stroke units at Oslo University Hospital, Akershus University Hospital, Østfold Hospital,and Bærum Hospital. Patients, who are admitted for rehabilitation at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, will also be included. In addition, patients earlier treated or on the waiting list at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, will be invited to participate. The investigators will also try to recruit patients from other rehabilitation institutions, and in cooperation with SLPs in the region of Oslo, Østfold and Akershus. The investigators will also invite for participation through the Aphasia Association of Norway (user organization).\n\nThe study aims at including 40 participants in each group, with a total number of 80 subjects. The investigators will include patients with aphasia in all stages following stroke including naming impairment. Patients under the age of 16 years and patients, who are unable to perform five hours of speech and language therapy per week due to medical or cognitive reasons, will be excluded.\n\nINTERVENTION:\n\nThe intervention group will receive speech and language therapy via videoconference while the control group will not receive any specific therapy as part of this study. Both groups will receive standard aphasia rehabilitation (usual care). The amount of standard aphasia rehabilitation (usual care) will be logged in all participants. Participants in the intervention group will receive speech-language training (SLT) for five hours a week over four consecutive weeks. The SLT will be performed by an SLP using videoconference via internet from Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital to the laptop in the patient's home, or rehabilitation/nursing ward. To secure treatment fidelity and replication for future studies, the investigators have used the template for intervention description and replication (TiDieR) checklist and guide to describe the intervention. The investigators will use the technical solution \"Cisco Jabber Video/Acano\" and the remote control software \"LogMeIn\", in the telerehabilitation that is given.\n\nPROCEDURES:\n\nThe stroke units will inform potential participants about the project and refer them to Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital for further investigation. Potential participants, who are patients at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital, receive information about the project and an invitation to take part in the trial. For recruitment from other rehabilitation institutions, local speech and language therapists, and for members of the Aphasia association of Norway, advertising in form of a flyer and a brochure is used. After referral an ambulatory visit by the PhD-fellow or research SLP will be performed. Detailed information about the project will be provided and the research investigator will request an informed consent before carrying out baseline testing. Baseline assessment is blinded as it is performed before group allocation. The four weeks control and follow-up-testing is performed by external SLPs blinded to group allocation. Directly after the intervention period (four weeks), the participant will be visited at home or come to the outpatient clinic at Sunnaas Rehabilitation Hospital. The laptop will be retrieved and assessment performed. The control group will be tested at the corresponding time point. A further follow-up assessment will be performed four months post randomization in all participants. The four weeks control and follow-up-testing is performed by external SLPs blinded to group allocation.\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES:\n\nTo investigate the effect of aphasia rehabilitation delivered by telemedicine, the investigators have chosen to look especially on naming as a measure of expressive language function. The investigators want to regard the prolonged effect of aphasia telerehabilitation on language function. Further on the investigators want to see the effect immediately after intervention and on other language functions than naming. The investigators also want to investigate whether SLT by videoconference can affect quality of life, if it is feasible and how persons with aphasia and therapists experience the telerehabilitation.\n\nFor the assessment of language functioning, the Norwegian Basic Aphasia Assessment (NGA) with the subtests conversational interview, naming, repetition and comprehension will be used.To assess the ability of sentence production, the investigators will use the Verb and Sentence Test (VAST) subtest sentence production. Functional communication will be assessed using Communicative Effectiveness Index (CETI). Quality of life will be assessed using Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life scale (SAQOL-39). In addition, the experiences of patients, relatives and therapists with the telerehabilitation services will be assessed using a questionnaire as well as semi-structured interviews with selected patients. There will be an interview with the SLPs performing the telerehabilitation.\n\nPrimary endpoint: Naming ability four months post randomization.\n\nSecondary endpoints:\n\nLanguage functions other than naming (repetition, comprehension, sentence production) four months post randomization.\nFunctional communication and quality of life four months post randomization..\nNaming and other language functions immediately after intervention.\nHow the telerehabilitation is experienced by patients and SLPs.\nFeasibility of telerehabilitation with regards to ethical, technical, logistic, patient and data safety aspects.\n\nANALYSES AND STATISTICS:\n\nThe investigators will use an intention to-treat (ITT) analysis. The trial is a longitudinal study that will give continuous repeated measurements, and the data will be analyzed using Mixed-models.

A deepening body of literature supports the use of ultrasound for the evaluation of appendicitis. In particular, ultrasound is being promoted as first line testing in the evaluation of appendicitis in pediatric populations and adults with BMI < 25. This approach reduces the risks related to radiation exposure and IV contrast dye. Unfortunately, in many practice settings, the availability of radiology-based sonographers is limited and there can be significant delays in obtaining ultrasound images. For these reasons, many ED physicians (EP) have begun to perform bedside ultrasound to evaluate for appendicitis.\n\nStudies have demonstrated a wide range in the accuracy of ultrasound for appendicitis. Sensitivities and specificities vary and no standardized diagnostic criterion exist. Additionally, little has been published directly studying EP point of care ultrasound in the evaluation for acute appendicitis. One study has shown that EP-performed ultrasounds had a relatively low sensitivity, but a high specificity. However, this study was performed by a wide range of users with varying skill levels and older ultrasound machines. The surgical literature suggests that the ability of the clinician to integrate the history, the physical exam and the ultrasound findings in real time improves the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for appendicitis.\n\nCurrently there are 4 physicians on staff in the ED who are fellowship trained in point of care emergency ultrasound, fully credentialed and are already performing ED based evaluations for appendicitis on a limited basis. The current standard of care is a point of care ultrasound as first-line imaging for patients with suspected appendicitis when a credentialed EP is available to perform the scan. We intend to evaluate the performance of EP-performed point of care ultrasound in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in ED patients. This study would primarily investigate the accuracy of ultrasound as compared to the criterion standard of either abdominal CT results or surgical pathology report.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN:\n\nThis will be a prospective, descriptive study of Emergency Department patients suspected of having acute appendicitis. Initial screening of potential enrollees will be performed by ED nurses, residents, and attendings. Once consented and enrolled, a study sonographer will interview and examine the patient, preferably before lab results are available. The ultrasound must be completed and adequate images obtained before other imaging modalities are completed. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant (RLQ) will performed using the graded compression technique described previously in the literature. All participating EP sonographers are already trained in this technique, fully credentialed and no additional training will be performed. A \"Bedside\" standardized data collection form will be used at the bedside to record ultrasound findings and clinical information. The sonographer will designate the appendix as \"not visualized\", \"visualized and normal\", or \"visualized and abnormal\" and the ultrasound as \"positive for appendicitis\", \"negative for appendicitis\" or \"indeterminate\" based on the exam and ultrasound findings.\n\nA second sonographer, blinded to all clinical information and the primary sonographer's ultrasound interpretation, will review the de-identified ultrasound images remotely. This overreading sonographer will record his interpretation and secondary findings on a \"Blinded Reviewer\" standardized data collection sheet.\n\nCT imaging, surgical pathology reports, and a two week telephone follow up will be utilized to determine final outcome of patient's clinical course. At this time, a third \"Follow Up\" standardized data collection sheet will be used to record patient outcomes and demographic information.\n\nBased on expected proportion of patients with proven appendicitis of 15% with desired precision of 0.15, the estimated sample size for this study is 261.\n\nSTUDY POPULATION AND RECRUITMENT METHODS:\n\nStudy population will include patients of any age presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a clinical suspicion of appendicitis. Patients will initially be seen by a treating attending physician or resident. If there is a concern for appendicitis the treating physician will contact one of the ultrasound credentialed EP sonographers to perform a point of care ultrasound. Of note, this is the current standard practice in the ED. By choosing to participate in the study, the patient's treatment is not altered in any way from the current standard practice, but simply is agreeing to allow us to collect data and contact them by phone at the two week follow up. The study sonographer will obtain consent. Parental consent will be obtained for patients under the age of 18.\n\nDATA TO BE UTILIZED:\n\nThe following data will be recorded:\n\nPatients initials\nPatient Medical Record Number (MRN)/Financial Identification Number (FIN)\nAge\nSex\nHeight\nWeight\nSymptom Duration\nChief complaint\nPresence of RLQ pain\nAnorexia\nMigration of pain to RLQ\nRebound tenderness\nNausea/vomiting\nMaximum recorded temperature in the Emergency Department\nWhite Blood Cell (WBC) count\nVisualization of the iliac vessels?\nVisualization of the appendix?\nMaximum outer diameter of the appendix\nThickness of the appendix wall\nEdema of the wall of the appendix?\nPeri-appendiceal edema or free fluid?\nNon compressible appendix?\nPain with compression over the appendix?\nEvidence of dilated bowel loops in the RLQ?\nIncreased vascularity of the appendix wall?\nAppendicolith?\nFree fluid in the right upper quadrant (RUQ)?\nDiagnostic impression of the sonographer\nDiagnostic impression of the blinded reviewer\nCT diagnosis\nPathology diagnosis\nOperative report classification\nTime to disposition\nFinal diagnosis\nSymptoms/Subsequent diagnosis at two weeks\n\nDATA ANALYSIS:\n\nFor the primary outcome, data will be used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of point of care (POC) US for the diagnosis of appendicitis compared to the criterion standard of CT, operative report, discharge diagnosis and two week follow up phone call.\n\nFor secondary outcomes, likelihood ratios for specific ultrasound findings will be determined. Inter-rater agreement between the bedside sonographer and the blinded reviewer will be calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Continuous, time-to-disposition data will be compared utilizing a two-tailed t-test.\n\nStatistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY).\n\nRISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT:\n\nThere are minimal risks to patients participating in this study since ultrasound is non-invasive and known to be safe. There is a slight risk of the participants' privacy or confidentiality being breached. Standard precautions will be taken to ensure privacy and confidentiality is maintained during the study.\n\nBENEFITS:\n\nPatients who have ultrasounds highly suspicious for appendicitis may be referred directly to surgery without further imaging being performed. In these instances study patients would benefit from reduced radiation exposure and faster referral for appropriate surgical care. The results of this study may be used to improve future patient care.\n\nCOMPENSATION / INCENTIVES AND RESEARCH-RELATED COSTS:\n\nNo compensation will be given to the participants. There will be no research-related costs.\n\nALTERNATIVE PROCEDURES:\n\nPatients who refuse to participate in the study will not have the quality of their treatment affected in any way.\n\nRESEARCH MATERIALS, METHODS AND CONFIDENTIALITY:\n\nResearch records will be stored in locked offices, filing cabinets, and computers using passwords.\n\nSUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT:\n\nWe will seek documented informed consent and HIPAA Authorization. ED patients meeting all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked if they would like to participate in the study by a research sonographer at the time of the ultrasound.\n\nIf the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent document will be given to them for their review. If patient declines to participate they will continue their treatment course in the Emergency Department.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nBurford JM, Dassinger MS, Smith SD.

The work up of patients with possible SBO is directed by the patient history, physical examination and pre-test probability. Relatively insensitive abdominal x-rays (AXR) are commonly ordered as a screening test, but computed tomography (CT) imaging is often necessary to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of SBO. This diagnostic process is time consuming, costly and exposes the patient to ionizing radiation.\n\nInterest in point-of-care (POC) ultrasonography (US) for the evaluation of suspected SBO has increased in recent years. A growing body of literature suggests US is more sensitive and specific compared to AXR in the diagnosis of SBO (1-3). US also confers the benefits of less radiation exposure and more rapid decision-making. CT is generally considered the diagnostic criterion standard for SBO, but effective use of POC US may reduce the need for CT imaging and expedite the care of patients with suspected SBO.\n\nCurrently, there are five emergency physicians (EP) on staff in the York Hospital ED who are fellowship trained in POC US. These physicians are fully credentialed and are already performing ED based evaluations for small bowel obstruction. We intend to evaluate the performance of EP-performed POC US in the diagnosis of SBO in ED patients. This study would primarily investigate the accuracy of ultrasound as compared to the criterion standard of abdominal CT results, intraoperative diagnosis, or discharge diagnosis.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThis will be a prospective, observational study of adult ED patients suspected of having a SBO. ED nurses, residents, and attendings will perform the initial screening for potential enrollees. Once consented and enrolled, a study sonographer will interview and examine the patient, preferably before labs and AXR results. The ultrasound must be completed and adequate images obtained before advanced imaging modalities are completed. Ultrasound of all four abdominal quadrants will be performed using the \"mowing the lawn\" technique described previously in the literature (4).\n\nThe ultrasounds will be performed by all five of the US fellowship-trained EPs on staff, as well as two current emergency ultrasound fellows and three emergency medicine residents. All will participate in the identification, consent, and enrollment of patients in the study.\n\nTrainees will undergo an hour-long educational session on POC US for SBO involving both lectures and hands on training. Methods for proper consent and data collection will be included. Blinded review of each ultrasound is already planned as a component of the study design and treatment decisions will not be made based on trainees ultrasounds unless supervised by a credentialed faculty member. The five faculty EP sonographers are already fully credentialed in POC ultrasound and familiar with the technique for SBO. No additional ultrasound training will be required for these participants.\n\nA \"Bedside\" standardized data collection form will be used at the bedside to record ultrasound findings and clinical information. The sonographer will designate the ultrasound as \"positive for small bowel obstruction,\" \"negative for small bowel obstruction,\" or \"indeterminate\" based on the exam and ultrasound findings.\n\nA second sonographer, blinded to all clinical information and the primary sonographer's ultrasound interpretation, will review the de-identified ultrasound images remotely. This over-reading sonographer will record his interpretation and secondary findings on a \"Blinded Reviewer\" standardized data collection sheet. Only fully credentialed, fellowship-trained EPs will serve as secondary, blinded reviewers. Current fellows and residents involved in the study will not review ultrasound images in this capacity.\n\nCT imaging, intraoperative reports, and discharge diagnosis will be utilized to determine final outcome of patient's clinical course. At this time, a third \"Follow Up\" standardized data collection sheet will be used to record patient outcomes and demographic information.\n\nIn general, CT reports will be used as the criterion standard to which POC US findings will be compared and by which sensitivity/specificity will be calculated. If no CT is obtained, then operative report(s) will serve as the criterion standard. If the patient does not receive CT imaging or undergo surgical intervention, then the discharge diagnosis will serve as the criterion standard.\n\nStudy population and recruitment methods:\n\nThe study population will include adult patients presenting to the emergency department with abdominal pain and a clinical suspicion of SBO. A treating attending physician or resident will evaluate the patient. If there is a concern for SBO, the treating physician will contact one of the ultrasound credentialed EP sonographers to perform a POC US to evaluate for possible SBO. This process is the current practice standard in the ED.\n\nAt this point, the EP sonographer will approach the patient regarding the study. If the patient agrees to participate, the EP sonographer will obtain informed consent. Of note, the patient's treatment is unchanged, regardless of whether or not he/she consents to participation in the study. The POC US will be obtained in either case, as this is standard clinical practice in the ED. Agreeing to participate will simply allow the study team to collect data and review their chart upon discharge from the hospital. The study sonographer will obtain consent.\n\nData to be collected:\n\nThe following data will be recorded:\n\nPatients initials\nPatient Medical Record Number (MRN)/Financial Number (FIN)\nAge\nSex\nHeight\nWeight\nChief complaint\nPresence/location of abdominal pain\nSymptom duration\nAssociated symptoms (i.e. nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, etc.)\nVisualization of the small bowel?\nMaximum inner diameter of the small bowel?\nPresence of \"to-and-fro\" peristalsis?\nEdema of the wall of the small bowel?\nPresence of free fluid surrounding the small bowel?\nPresence of sonographic transition point?\nDiagnostic impression of the sonographer\nDiagnostic impression of the blinded reviewer\nXR findings\nCT diagnosis\nOperative report classification\nTime of patient placement in ED bed\nTime of consultation or ED discharge\nDischarge diagnosis\n\nData analysis:\n\nFor the primary outcome, data will be used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of POC US for the diagnosis of SBO compared to the criterion standard of CT or operative report.\n\nFor secondary outcomes, likelihood ratios for specific ultrasound findings will be determined. Inter-rater agreement between the bedside sonographer and the blinded reviewer will be calculated using Cohen's kappa coefficient. Continuous, time-to-disposition data will be compared utilizing a two-tailed t-test.\n\nStatistical analysis will be performed using SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY).\n\nRisks and risk management:\n\nThere are minimal risks to patients participating in this study since ultrasound is non-invasive and known to be safe.

ED patients meeting all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked if they would like to participate in the study by a research sonographer at the time of the ultrasound.\n\nIf the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent document will be given to them for their review.

There are currently five FDA-approved medication formulations, which relative to placebo have demonstrated effectiveness in helping patients attain abstinence from opioids. Nonetheless, patients' opioid abstinence rates are sub-optimal: even when treated with the newest extended-release formulations only about 40% of patients maintain abstinence during the first 6-months of treatment. Contingency management (CM; i.e., motivational incentives for achieving pre-defined treatment goals) is one of the only behavioral interventions shown to improve patient abstinence from opioids when combined with FDA-approved pharmacotherapy.

Children and adults with PD present with limb-girdle muscular weakness, diaphragm weakness and impaired breathing ability. Further, patients with classic infantile PD suffer from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To date, the muscle pathology and the extent of the disease can be assessed using invasive techniques (e.g., muscle biopsies) or imaging (e.g., MRI). These techniques are time consuming, and especially in young patients, require anesthesia, which increases the acute risk of respiratory failure.\n\nMultispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) allows the detection of specific endogenous chromophores like collagen, myoglobin or hemoglobin by using a non-invasive approach comparable to conventional ultrasound. Instead of sound waves, MSOT illuminates tissue with near-infrared light of transient energy, which is absorbed and results in thermo-elastic expansion of certain molecules. This expansion generates ultrasound waves that are detected by the same device. Multispectral illumination and unmixing then allows the precise localisation and quantification of muscle-specific subcellular structures. MSOT has already been demonstrated the potential to visualize the muscular structure and the clinical extent of muscular disease in patients with Duchenne muscle dystrophy and differentiates those patients from healthy volunteers.\n\nThe aim of the study is to establish glycogen as a novel PD-specific imaging target using MSOT-imaging. It intends to identify a PD-specific muscle pathology-signature by quantification of already established targets (collagen, myoglobin, hemoglobin, glycogen if applicable). This signature will aid in differentiating PD from other muscular pathologies and healthy volunteers and will ultimately serve as a potential non-invasive monitoring biomarker."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["May 17, 2022"],"CompletionDate":["December 1, 2022"],"DetailedDescription":["Pompe disease (PD) is a rare, autosomal-recessive disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme (GAA), leading to generalized build-up of glycogen, especially in the heart, muscle, liver and nervous system. Among the glycogen storage diseases, PD is the only one with a defect in lysosomal metabolism.\n\nPD is considered as a progressive disease with variation by age of onset, severity of organ involvement and degree of myopathy. This great phenotypic variability has led to the creation of types based on the age of onset and degree of organ involvement. They all have in common, that symptoms of affected patients are expected to worsen over time if left untreated. The classification is generally based on the age of onset as infantile (infantile onset Pompe disease, IOPD) when it presents during the first 12 months of life and late-onset (LOPD) when first symptoms appear after 12 months of age. If cardiomyopathy is present, IODP is generally referred to as classic Pompe disease (however there may be variably classification in the literature with the infantile or childhood forms). Clinically, infants with classic PD present during the first few months of life with rapidly progressive disease characterized by prominent hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, hypotonia, generalized muscle weakness, macroglossia, feeding difficulties and respiratory insufficiency. Mortality rate is high by one year of age if untreated. Patients with non-classic PD will usually present within the first year of life with motor developmental delay and weakness, but without clinically relevant cardiac involvement. The rate of clinical progression is slower in these children and without treatment, death will usually occur in childhood as a result of respiratory insufficiency. LODP include childhood and adult-onset PD. These patients generally present with slowly progressive limb girdle type weakness and respiratory insufficiency without significant cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of PD is usually established by the typical clinical presentation, followed by confirmation of GAA deficiency in dried blood spots, e.g. through new-born screening. Further (confirmatory) methods include GAA activity measurement in lymphocytes, muscle or skin fibroblasts, as well as GAA mutation testing. All of them are invasive techniques. Early identification is important as it will likely significantly improve the outcome for all patients with PD as treatment can be initiated earlier. Treating the underlying cause of PD involves the replacement of the missing enzyme GAA via enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa (recombinant human GAA, rhGAA). Currently, this is the only specific treatment approved for PD. In classical IOPD, treatment significantly lengthens survival and improves motor development and respiratory and cardiac function. The sooner ERT begins, the better are the results. With ERT being one very important aspect of care, patients will also need a multidisciplinary approach to ensure that all aspects of the disease are addressed.Regardless of age of onset and severity, all patients with PD should be monitored prospectively. However, there is lack of standardization across centers. A variety of clinical evaluations and tests are currently used for monitoring Pompe's disease, which may include laboratory tests including CK, AST, ALT, and LDH, cardiologic tests including electrocardiogram and echocardiogram and respiratory tests including sleep studies and breathing tests to measure lung capacity. To quantify muscle involvement electromyography is an option as well as clinical tests including 6 minutes walking test or timed to up and go test. Muscle MRI of affected patients often show fatty degeneration of muscles. One study showed that muscle MRI correlates with muscle function in patients with adult-onset Pompe disease. Another study suggested that muscle imaging data in late-onset Pompe disease reveal a correlation between the pre-existing degree of lipomatous muscle alterations and the efficacy of long-term enzyme replacement therapy. For small children, however, there is always a need for sedation for MRI's, limiting its use. Therefore, ultrasound is another option to examine children's muscles.\n\nAt the moment there are no prospective biomarkers available to detect muscle degeneration at an early age and/or to follow up disease progression or ERT-treated patients. Within the last years our multidisciplinary research team (Medical Department 1, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Erlangen) published a novel non-invasive imaging modality to be able to detect subcellular tissue composition in vivo. Multi-spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT), an imaging technology comparable to ultrasound, allows quantitative imaging in patients of all ages (including the non-sedated child)."],"EnrollmentCount":["30"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Diagnostic"]},{"Rank":420,"NCTId":["NCT02897921"],"OfficialTitle":["Clinical Importance of Carrier Status of Recessive Gene Mutations in Myopathy"],"OverallStatus":["Unknown status"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["Many myopathies are inherited in a recessive manner, but in some of these recessively inherited disorders, clinical manifestations may potentially manifest in carriers of just a single mutation.\n\nThe aim of the study is to describe the clinical characteristics of single mutation carriers of recessive myopathy, through measuring serum creatine kinase, muscle strength, muscle degeneration (by MRI) and heart affection.

This has recently been demonstrated by researchers for the recessively inherited limb girdle muscle dystrophy (LGMD) type 2A, where carriers of single mutations can also be symptomatic. In X-linked recessively inherited dystrophinopathies caused by mutations in the DMD gene on chromosome Xp21, female mutation carriers may also manifest with disease, although this is often milder than affected men. In the recently discovered LGMD2L, manifesting carriers are also suspected. Thus, according to statistics, too many persons evaluated for myopathy carry a single LGMD2L mutation.\n\nSome previous studies have looked into the significance of being a single mutation carrier in recessive muscle disease. In dystrophinopathy, it was reported that 5 % of female DMD carriers reported myalgia and cramps, 17 % experienced mild-to-moderate muscle weakness and 8 % experienced dilated cardiomyopathy, with a mean onset age of approximately 30 years. Another study found that echocardiographic examination was abnormal in up to 38% of DMD female carriers - some with dilated cardiomyopathy, and some with left ventricle dilatation.\n\nOverall, however significance of carrying a single mutation of recessive myopathy is widely unexplored. No study has yet investigated the characteristics of single mutation carriers of recessive myopathy in an observational, cross-sectional study.\n\nAim:\n\nIn this study, clinical characteristics of single mutation carriers of recessive myopathies will be investigated.

One of the major limitations of conventional laparoscopy is lack of depth perception. Introduction of 3D imaging, has removed many of these technical obstacles.

Starting from this, we can theorize an impact of 3D technologies on surgeon's learning curves. This concern is recently being demonstrated in experimental and clinical setting with improvement of hand-eye coordination, better laparoscopic skills and less time to learn surgical procedure.

Objective measurements of skin muscles such as thickness and volume, in preoperative assessment of a facial paralysis rehabilitation surgery, would be useful in order to choose the most appropriate surgical technique. Indeed, too much amyotrophy will contraindicate hypoglosso-facial anastomosis (VII-XII) and it will be preferable to propose a temporal elongation myoplasty or a reinfused free muscle flap.\n\nSimilarly, it would be useful to be able to objectively evaluate the recovery of muscle function after facial allo-transplantation.\n\nAlthough electromyography has been developed since the work of Duchenne de Boulogne, little research has been carried out on the development of noninvasive methods to objectively characterize in vivo skin muscles (variation, position, orientation, morphometry).

Certain psychiatric diseases, such as behavioural addictions, social anxiety disorder, and arachnophobia, are characterized by a dysfunctional tendency to either approach or avoid disease-specific objects. This tendency can be measured by means of the approach and avoidance task. In this so-called diagnostic AAT participants are instructed to react upon the format or the frame colour of a picture. For instance, pictures have to be pushed away if they are presented in landscape format and pulled towards oneself if they are presented in portrait format (or vice versa). Hence, the format (or the frame colour) becomes the task-relevant dimension, whereas the content of the picture becomes the task-irrelevant dimension. However, what generally becomes obvious in the psychiatric diseases mentioned above is that the task-irrelevant dimension (picture content) exerts an influence on reaction times. For instance, alcoholic patients are generally faster to respond if alcoholic pictures are presented in a format requiring them to pull towards themselves and slower to respond if alcoholic pictures are shown in the format requiring them to push away a joystick. This behavioural tendency has been termed an approach bias for alcohol.\n\nIn order to counteract these dysfunctional approach or avoidance tendencies, an AAT-training has been developed. In this training participants/patients learn to either avoid or approach disease-specific objects. Alcohol-dependent patients, for instance, learn to avoid alcohol-related pictures by pushing or swiping the image away. It has been shown that these trainings can enhance treatment outcome (e.g. lower relapse rates) among alcohol-addicted patients (Wiers, Eberl, Rinck, Becker, & Lindenmeyer, 2011). The aim of the current study is to test whether the avoidance gesture is as important as suggested by the AAT's name or whether inhibiting the urge to approach alcoholic content might be enough to bring about the effect."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["February 2, 2017"],"CompletionDate":["August 31, 2020"],"DetailedDescription":["The approach and avoidance task (AAT) has turned out as both a promising diagnostic tool as well as treatment add-on in psychological science. The AAT constitutes one form of cognitive bias modification (CBM), which has been shown to be particularly effective in the field of behavioral addictions, such as alcohol addiction (Eberl et al., 2013; Wiers et al., 2011). The general logic underlying the AAT is to carry out actions that are either compatible or incompatible with an individual's action tendencies. For instance, alcohol addicted patients tend to approach alcohol related stimuli faster than control pictures (i.e. soft drink stimuli), when they are instructed to react upon the format of a picture and not to its' content. This tendency of comparatively faster approaching and slower avoiding alcohol-related stimuli than soft drink content has been termed an approach bias for alcohol. The AAT as a therapeutic tool tries to counteract or at least to attenuate approach or avoidance biases by instructing patients to carry out approach and avoidance gestures that are in conflict with an individual's acquired action tendencies.\n\nWhereas the general effectiveness of the AAT as a clinical intervention has been demonstrated several times, little is known about possible mechanisms that might subserve these effects. Therefore, the current study is dedicated to shed some light on one such potential mechanism, i.e. the role of the avoidance gesture within the alcohol-AAT.\n\nAs already suggested by the name of the AAT, the avoidance gesture seems to be a key ingredient in bringing about therapeutic effects. However, recent empirical evidence has brought about some interesting findings, giving rise to an alternative explanation.\n\nA study by Kühn et al. (2017), contrary to common-held beliefs, indicated that inhibition capacity can be trained. Inhibition, in turn, consistently has been linked to psychopathology and all kinds of behavioural addictions (Smith, Mattick, Jamadar, & Iredale, 2014). The game by Kühn et al. (2017) used to train inhibition resembled the AAT in several ways, e.g. certain stimuli appearing on a treadmill had to be collected by swiping towards oneself and others had to be ignored and the objects slowly disappeared. The latter element contrasts with the AAT, since the ignored objects don't have to be pushed away. However, it resembles the AAT in the sense that in both cases stimuli slowly fade out of the screen and eventually disappear. These parallel let to the assumption that a new form of the alcohol AAT training might be equally effective in lowering relapse rates among alcoholic patients. More precisely, within the newly conceptualized AAT training patients are instructed to inhibit the urge to respond in response to alcohol-related content and to observe the stimuli fading out of the screen. In contrast, to the classical AAT training this zooming out of alcoholic stimuli is not conditional on an avoidance gesture, i.e. swiping/pushing away the stimulus.\n\nIt is hypothesized that compared to a control group, in which alcohol and soft drink stimuli have to be swiped to the left and right, both the classical AAT-and the inhibition group will show lower relapse rates and approach biases after the intervention, i.e. a training period of three weeks. No intergroup differences in terms of relapse rates and alcohol-related approach bias are expected for the classical AAT group and the inhibition group."],"EnrollmentCount":["90"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":430,"NCTId":["NCT04763720"],"OfficialTitle":["Implementation of Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy for Children and Their Families in an Outpatient Setting."],"OverallStatus":["Enrolling by invitation"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation and use of Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy (DDP) in three centra, with particular focus on its potential effects on the quality of the observable caregiver-child interaction.

There is an excess of treatable coronary heart disease risk factors in such siblings and a high prevalence of adult atherosclerosis.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nThe study recruited 364 siblings of individuals with early coronary disease. Eligible subjects were randomized to community-based care (CBC) or enhanced primary care (EPC) with a community health site neighborhood health worker/nurse for 1 year follow up. Intervention participants were stratified based on results of treadmill testing to either more or less aggressive management of their lipids according to National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. All positive participants on the exercise stress test were directly referred to their physicians. Diabetics were referred to their primary physician for treatment. Intervention in the intervention group was carried out on traditional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors including diet, physical activity, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and cigarette smoking. The intervention built on a prior sibling study in Blacks and whites.\n\nThe approach was that, rather than carrying out the intervention at the central John Hopkins Clinic, thus requiring transportation of potentially anxious participants to a strange environment, the new interventions were carried out by trained local NHWs in a more accessible local community site. The nutrition interventions used fat counters that focused on total fat gram goals, and intervention was carried out by the NHW/N with assistance from cookbooks appropriate for African American households. Siblings were requested to come monthly for dietary counseling. Smoking cessation interventions used individual counseling previously carried out by the investigators. Smoking assessment included self-report and measures of carbon monoxide (CO) in expired air. Study physicians carried out pharmacologic interventions for blood pressure, lipids and lipoproteins. Diabetes treatment was through referral to the patient's private physician. Nurses provided oversight to NHWs.\n\nNeighborhood health workers were trained and certified in taking blood pressure (BP), phlebotomy, and CO measurements at the Center for Health Promotion at Johns Hopkins, which had an NHW training program for blood pressure. Outcomes measures included changes in blood pressure, smoking behavior, and plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins.

Tics present as sudden, rapid, repetitive non-rhythmic movements or vocalizations or a combination. Tics may be extremely distressing in a child's life, but the severity of tics is often variable. The group of children/ adolescents with tic disorders are heterogenous when it comes to symptom presentation, comorbid conditions and social status. This places great demands on professionals to offer the right treatment at the right time. The aim of the current project is to make optimal tics training more accessible, including for patients managed in primary care, to make optimal treatment available in the immediate environment, and to ensure increased adherence to treatment.\n\nAs part of this project, an app has been developed and the study aims to evaluate mobile app-assisted behavioral treatment as an efficient and feasible approach that may be a valuable tool together with other treatment approaches. The mobile app-assisted training is based on the manual \"Niks til Tics\", which describes training with a combination of Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) over nine sessions. Both HRT and ERP are known to be effective treatments of tics.\n\nIn this project a randomized controlled superiority trial evaluates the effect of app-assisted training versus an educational approach.

Treatment of a chronic tic disorder primarily comprises therapeutic intervention which consists of ERP (Exposure Response Prevention) and/or HRT (Habit Reversal Training).\n\nThe purpose of the project is to\n\nEvaluate the treatment outcome of combined video consultation/participating in training sessions at the hospital and of combined self-instructed video training/participating in training sessions at the hospital.\nCompare the treatment outcome of supplementary virtual consultation and supplementary video training via an app with a previous study on the treatment outcome of attending individual therapy (NISSEN, 2018) by means of benchmarking.\nIn addition, expound on the significance of sensory modulation (sensitivity), not-just-right experience and the child's perception with regard to the severity of chronic tics and treatment outcome. Also, to investigate whether insight, sensitivity and the not-just-right experience change during treatment.\nAs the app is newly developed in relation to the present study, the investigators wish to clarify the participants' evaluation of the app using a newly developed questionnaire (designed for this project). For comparison, a questionnaire has been designed for evaluating the applicability of the supplementary video sessions.\n\nWhen patients are referred to the Tourette outpatient clinic, Aarhus University Hospital, Psychiatry, a comprehensive diagnostic assessment is carried out. The assessment is based on a modified version of the Schedule for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age children - present and lifetime version (K-SADS-PL). The K-SADS-PL information is used for confirming the primary diagnosis of chronic tics and for ensuring that none of the exclusion criteria have been met.\n\nInclusion criteria\n\nThe inclusion criteria are defined based on the ICD-10 diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems):\n\nChronic motor/vocal tics (DF95.1) Tourette syndrome (DF95.2), Age spectrum: 9-17 years old\n\nExclusion criteria\n\nThe exclusion criteria are defined as follows:\n\nPatients with comorbidity such as mental retardation (IQ = 70 or less), psychosis, severe depression requiring treatment, suicidal behavior/threats or severe eating disorder.\n\nParticipated in tics training based on HRT/ERP treatment within the last six months.\n\nOral and written consent will be obtained from parents and children/adolescents (age 15 years and older).\n\nThe study will be an open, randomized controlled clinical study for children and adolescents with chronic tics disorders. The participants will be randomized using computer-generated randomization based on age and sex.\n\nThe participants will either be randomized for tics training with attendance combined with virtual training (group 1) or a combination of attendance and self-instructed training via videos on an app (group 2). Both settings are based on the \"Niks til Tics\" manual (NISSEN, 2018) that describes training in Habit Reversal Training (HRT) and Exposure Response Prevention (ERP) over nine sessions. Thus, two treatment groups will be set up:\n\nGroup 1 (treatment group 1) will consist of nine entire sessions (60 min each), but where four out of the nine sessions will be converted to video consultations. The content of the video consultations is comparable to the information and training the patients would have received if they attended at the clinic and which are defined in the \"Niks til Tics\" manual.\n\nGroup 2 (treatment group 2) will comprise five entire sessions (60 min) with clinic attendance, but where sessions 1 and 2 will be combined into one session with a duration of 120 min, session 4 will be held as usual with attendance after five weeks, session 8 will be held ten weeks after session 4, and session 9 will be held after two months. In addition, patients in group 2 will be given the opportunity to talk to the therapist on the phone. For the group 2 training sessions, an app has been developed for teaching patients the tics training method. A new app session will be released at each new treatment session, and the content of the app videos will follow the information and training, which the patients would have received if they had attended at the clinic and which are defined in the \"Niks til Tics\" manual.\n\nAll tic training sessions will be individual. The primary outcome goal includes the Yale Global Tics Severity Scale (YGTSS) in session 8. In order to follow the treatment, a parent report questionnaire and a self-report questionnaire will be used and evaluated in accordance with YGTSS (Golden standard). The questionnaires are based on Parent Tic Questionnaire (PTQ). Secondary outcome measures are Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED), the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ), Premonitory Urge Scale (PUTS), Beliefs About Tics Scale (BATS), NJR-C (not just right experiences), CATS (thoughts about experiences children may be exposed to), W-tc (worrying thoughts) and motivation questionnaire, and the parents are asked to fill in CBCL, BQ (general information) as well as a sensory profile (about hypersensitivity).\n\nStatistical analyses The primary analysis will comprise a comparison of effect sizes within the treatment group, that is, an assessment of the reduction in tic intensity during the eight sessions. The difference in tic intensity between baseline and session 8 will be assessed at t-test. Effect sizes will be calculated by a ratio of the mean difference and the standard deviation of the difference between baseline and session 8 (SD diff). The confidence interval for effect sizes will be calculated using non-parametric bootstrap with 100 replications. At group sizes of 30 with an expected uniform YGTSS baseline of 25 (randomized) and with an expected SD of 6.2 (from a previous study (NISSEN 2018)), and a strength of 0.8 it should be possible to detect a decrease of point 3.4 (from baseline to session 8), which is statistically significant.\n\nResponder level will be defined as a 25% reduction of the YGTSS total tics score.\n\nThe secondary analyses will study the reduction in tic intensity between the two treatment groups using unpaired t-test. At a group size of 30 and expected end YGTSS of 15 (SD 6.2) and strength of 0.80 (from a previous study (NISSEN 2018)), a difference of 4.6 between the two groups will be statistically significant.\n\nPredictor analysis: baseline characteristics and baseline tic severity between the two groups will be compared using univariate Chi test for categorical variables and t-tests for continuous variables.\n\nTic severity will be assessed by independent raters.\n\nUsing benchmarking, the results of this treatment study will be compared with the results from a previous treatment study on HRT/ERP (NISSEN, 2018)."],"EnrollmentCount":["31"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":469,"NCTId":["NCT04594044"],"OfficialTitle":["Group Therapy Versus Individual Therapy in Children and Adolescents With Tourette Syndrome and Chronic Tic Disorder"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Chronic tic disorder (CTD) may have a huge impact on life quality.

Endothelial dysfunction (ED) is the main mechanism which leads to atherosclerosis, where the balance between pro and antioxidant factors results in a decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Xanthine OxidoReductase (XOR) is one of the main generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Uric acid (UA), a major antioxidant in human plasma and end product of purine metabolism, is associated with cardiovascular diseases since many years; however the precise mechanisms which relate UA to ED are still not well understood.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to unravel the XOR and UA pathways involved in ED. Three groups of participants (young (< 40 y) male healthy participants [1] ; male and female helthy participants (40 to 65 y) [2] and patients with primary hypertension [3]) will be exposed to febuxostat (a strong and selective XOR inhibitor), or recombinant uricase (which oxidizes UA into allantoin) to vary UA levels and concomitantly control for confounding changes in XOR activity. Oxidative stress will be estimated by several markers. Endothelial function will be assessed by a laser Doppler imager in the presence of hyperthermia and endothelium stimulators. This study is specifically designed to untie the respective effects of UA and XOR pathways on oxidative stress and endothelial function in humans.\n\nThe investigators will test the following hypothesis:\n\nAn extremely low level of uric acid after uricase administration induces endothelial dysfunction and oxydative stress,\nA specific XO inhibitor limits unfavourable effects of the serum UA reduction elicited by uricase administration,\nEndothelial function and oxydative stress are further improved with febuxostat as compared to placebo,\nAll these observations are more marked in hypertensives then in older participants than in young healthy subjects."],"CollaboratorName":["Fonds Erasme","Fonds National de la Recherche Scientifique"],"StartDate":["January 3, 2018"],"CompletionDate":["February 27, 2020"],"DetailedDescription":["The goals of the research protocol are to clearly untie the respective roles of uric acid (UA) and xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) pathways on endothelial function and oxidative stress in humans.\n\nUA represents the end-product of purine metabolism due to the loss of uricase 15 million years ago in humans. The selective advantage of this mutation could be the strong antioxidant effect of UA (which represents more than 60% of the antioxidant plasmatic capacity). Many recent epidemiological studies have showed a J-shape association between UA levels and cardiovascular risk. An UA level lower than 3 mg/dl could be damageable due to the loss of the antioxidant properties of UA. In contrast, hyperuricemia is associated with an increased inflammation, insulin resistance, ED, platelet aggregation, left ventricle hypertrophy, arterial vasodilatation impairment, aortic stiffness and intima-media thickness. However, the association between UA and cardiovascular disease remains controversial because whether UA is an independent risk factor for these illnesses is unclear.\n\nInterventional studies:\n\nBecause the above-mentioned associations do not prove causation, several authors designed interventional studies with the purpose to modify UA levels and determine if this affected endothelial function and oxidative stress. The main limitation of these studies is that they were unable to untie the effects of the synthesis of UA, of UA itself and of the activity of XOR, on ROS production and endothelial function in humans.\n\nThis is because:\n\nserum UA is a powerful plasmatic antioxidant,\nbut transformation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to UA by XO generates intracellular ROS,\nmoreover, in endothelial cells, UA reduces NO bioavailability by many ways (L-arginine blockade and degradation, increased superoxide anion production, NOS inhibition, reduced NOS genes expression and direct NO scavenging),\nin addition, UA forms crystals in the endothelium wall which create a pro-inflammatory and thrombotic state, increases smooth muscle cells proliferation and also insulin resistance and inflammation in adipocytes,\nfinally, and most importantly, XO is inhibited by physiologic levels of UA (which acts as an uncompetitive XO inhibitor).\n\nIn summary, the present protocol aims at testing the following hypothesis:\n\nExperimental serum UA variations are correlated with endothelial function and oxydative stress markers : an extremely low level after uricase administration induces ED and oxydative stress,\nA specific XO inhibitor (FX) limits unfavourable effects of the serum UA reduction elicited by uricase administration, since this will hamper the feedback activation of XO by a low UA level,\nEndothelial function and oxydative stress are further improved with FX as compared to placebo, because the first experimental condition results in a XO blockade,\nAll these observations are more marked in hypertensive patients then in older participants than in young healthy subjects.\n\nData collection\n\nData collection from the participants will be collected informatically through a case report form.

Zolpidem (Ambien) is often prescribed as a first line agent to treat sleep difficulties in patients presenting with sleep related complaints to Primary Care Practitioners (PCP's). Zolpidem is currently available in two doses, 10 and 5 mg. These doses were developed in clinical studies carried out primarily on men. The first dose made clinically available, 10 mg, resulted in morbidity and mortality in many women because women metabolize Zolpidem at a slower rate than men, thus the half-life is longer. Women taking Zolpidem often had morning drowsiness, persistent sleepiness, and difficulty with tasks requiring coordination and judgement, such as motor vehicle operation. There were a number of well publicized motor vehicle crashes and fatalities attributed to Zolpidem, mostly among women. The company then produced a 5 mg dose; however, some women still reported side effects at the lower dose, suggesting persistent drug levels in the morning, when the drug purportedly should have been cleared from the body. These women would likely benefit from a lower dose, a dose personalized for their individual metabolisms and sleep difficulties. Lower doses of Zolpidem are only available from compounding pharmacies, which are not common, are expensive, do not take many insurances, and are not offered as an option to most patients. Vitae Industries, Inc. is a start-up tech company located in Providence, founded by a Brown University graduate, a chemical engineer, who has developed technology that can provide precisely varied amounts of drug for specific and variable personalized patient dosing. Personalized medicine is an area of great research and clinical interest to the medical community at large and the Brown University Medical School in particular. Brown also has a growing focus on issues of sex and gender in the rendering of clinical medical care. This technology has the potential to address both of these areas, providing the possibility of very specific, tailored drug dosing for men and women. This research was developed as a proof of concept study which will be carried out as a collaboration between Brown University Medical School/Lifespan physicians and the technical staff at Vitae Industries, Inc.. This work will be foundational and will serve as the medical and scientific justification for Vitae Industry's providing patient specific dosing of medications. For the purposes of this study, the medication to be tested, Zolpidem (Ambien) will be compounded by a licensed compounding Rhode Island pharmacy, PhusionRx, using standardized approaches to compounding and formulating pharmaceutical products. This study will use low doses of Zolpidem formulated by the licensed compounding pharmacy, PhusionRx. The investigators will provide graduated doses of Zolpidem to women participants meeting inclusion criteria who present to their primary care physician complaining of difficulty achieving satisfactory sleep. Participants will start at a dose of 0.5 mg of Zolpidem. Each day the quality of their sleep will be assessed by self-report.

It has been suggested that the traditional approach to nutrition labeling is difficult for children to use; this is unfortunate as childhood is a critical time for developing long-lasting eating habits and children influence purchase decisions.\n\nMaterials and Methods Children aged 6-10 played a video game in which participants fed \"Munchy Monster\" the healthier of two cereal products presented on a computer screen.

Minimal training (awareness of the FOPs existence and that it might contain nutrition information) further improved accuracy and speed of responses.\n\nConclusions FOPs that leverage visual indicators assist even young children in assessing the nutritional value of a product."],"CollaboratorName":["United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)"],"StartDate":["February 2, 2016"],"CompletionDate":["April 12, 2016"],"DetailedDescription":["Background It has been estimated that only two percent of children eat a diet that is consistent with the Food Guide pyramid, consuming diets that are too high in fat, saturated fat and sodium, and too low in fiber. Furthering concerns associated with these statistics is the fact that childhood is a determinant phase in the establishment of eating habits, and that developing healthy eating practices as a child has long-term health benefits.\n\nThat said, children are an attractive segment for food marketers. Children are not only represent a primary market with growing access to discretionary income, children also have significant power to influence decisions and are a promising future market. As such, kids represent an attractive target for marketers, and research suggests vulnerability to the messages which target them.\n\nIt has been suggested that directing messages to children \"increases children's preferences for the foods advertised and increases their requests to parents for those foods.\" Recognizing this, packaging plays an important role in the marketing mix. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has estimated that 12% of all youth marketing expenditures are spent on packaging and in-store in store display materials. This is because of packaging's ability to influence purchase within retail spaces, at the point where purchasing decisions are made; something researchers have referred to as the \"nag factor.\"\n\nClearly, the idea of presenting information directed at children using packaging for the purpose of motivating sales is utilized; however, the idea of presenting regulated information (e.g. nutritional information) in a format that might be readily understood by this vulnerable audience has not been widely explored. A major goal of nutritional labeling on food packages is to help consumers make appropriate choices. However, the current approach to nutritional labeling is targeted at adults, rather than children.\n\nAlthough children as young as age four are capable of classifying familiar foods (e.g. ice cream vs. broccoli) as healthy or unhealthy, the investigators are the first to examine whether children can use visual cues from Front of Pack (FOP) labels to compare and evaluate food products from the same category (cereal). FOP labels appear on the front of packages and provide truncated information about nutrients that tend to be associated with disease (e.g. fats, trans fats, sugar and sodium).\n\nTwo semi-directive overlays, namely, color (2 levels present/absent) and facial icon (present and absent) were crossed, for a total of four FOP treatments. The study investigated color because it represents the traffic light system, which is a standard FOP design in the United Kingdom (UK), and its use is a topic of significant debate globally. Investigators also tested the efficacy of schematic facial expressions representing relatively high, medium, and low values for nutrients (i.e. frowning for high; straight face for moderate and a smile for those low). Overwhelming evidence indicates that face stimuli are given extremely high attentional priority and that the processing of facial expressions of emotion requires very few cognitive resources. These findings suggest that a face stimulus might be a particularly effective stimulus for drawing attention to the FOP nutritional panel and conveying relative qualitative information about the nutritional value of a product. As such, study investigators postulated that FOP utilizing faces would be particularly well-suited for use with children. Faces are known for garnering increased attention in infants and children as young as age 4 can reliably identify facial expressions of emotion. In fact, developmental research often exploits children's ease of comprehending iconic faces to measure children's judgments of stimuli or situations.\n\nMaterials and Methods Investigators leverage these fundamental insights in work presented here, such insights can be used in ways that positively enhance attention to and understanding of nutrition information in a vulnerable audience, children aged 6 to 10.\n\nChildren were seated at a computer and given a brief overview of the game. The program began with an instruction scene in which a purple monster character (Munchy) said\n\n\"Hi my name is Munchy. I like to eat, but only healthy foods. Will you please feed me? In the game, you will see two cereal boxes. One is healthier than the other. To feed me please press the button on the side with the healthy cereal. If you select the healthy one I will eat it and you will get points. If you select the unhealthy one I will refuse to eat and you will not get any points. I am really hungry so please choose the healthy one as fast as you can. Do you have any questions?\"\n\nFor each trial, both cereals had the same FOP treatment. However, one package contained \"healthy levels\" of key nutrients (e.g. for colored FOP three or more nutrients at \"green levels\") while the other contained \"unhealthy levels\" (three or more nutrients at \"red levels\"). Nutrients were categorized into high, moderate and low levels based on Traffic Light Label Guidelines released by the Food Standards Agency. The appearance of the brand and the position of the package (right or left side of screen) were randomized; additionally, a second randomization was done with the healthfulness level of the nutrition information such that the positioning (right side of screen or left) was randomized. As a result, for one subject brand X might appear as healthy, while for another it might be presented with unhealthy information. Each participant completed 80 trials, with each of the four FOP designs appearing in 20 trials per participant by the conclusion of the game. The time it took for the participant to make a correct choice was recorded along with a binary response of correct choice (yes or no).\n\nTwo blocks of participants were recruited. In the first block, no reference was made to the FOP labeling. For the second block of participants, at the beginning of the experiment, in addition to being shown the basic premise of the game and told that Munchy preferred to eat healthy options, the researcher pointed to one of the FOPs and told children \"this information might be helpful when you decide what's healthy.\""],"EnrollmentCount":["80"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Prevention"]},{"Rank":480,"NCTId":["NCT02069106"],"OfficialTitle":["An 8-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate Daily Pro-Omega LDL for Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Triglyceride Reduction in Subjects With Mixed Hyperlipoproteinemia"],"OverallStatus":["Withdrawn"],"Phase":["Phase 4"],"BriefSummary":["Pro-Omega LDL reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in subjects with mixed hyperlipoproteinemia."],"CollaboratorName":["Nutrasource Pharmaceutical and Nutraceutical Services, Inc."],"StartDate":["February 2014"],"CompletionDate":["July 2014"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["0"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":481,"NCTId":["NCT00136617"],"OfficialTitle":["Comparison of a Fixed-Schedule Therapy Versus a Symptom-Triggered Therapy for Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome in Medical Out-Patients"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Phase 3"],"BriefSummary":["The purpose of this study is to compare a fixed-schedule therapy versus a symptom-triggered therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome in medical outpatients.\n\nObjectives:\n\nSelf-governance in monitoring AWS (alcohol withdrawal syndrome) symptoms and medication\nClinically controlled trial of two regimens for medical treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome\nOutpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome"],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["August 2003"],"CompletionDate":["September 2008"],"DetailedDescription":["The objective of this study is to compare a fixed-schedule therapy versus a symptom-triggered therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome in medical outpatients.\n\nObjectives:\n\nSelf-governance in monitoring AWS (alcohol withdrawal syndrome) symptoms and medication\nClinically controlled trial of two regimens for medical treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome\nOutpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome\n\nPatients and Methods:\n\nThis study is a prospective analysis of patients admitted to a medical outpatient clinic between August 25, 2003 and July 1, 2006, who experienced AWS.

The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of the Federal University of Ceará, accredited by the National Commission for Research Ethics - National Health Council, Ministry of Health and the Scientific Committee of the Hospital General Dr. César Cals. The study was performed according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2013 and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\nStudy design and pharmacokinetic sampling\n\nThis study was performed as a monocentric, open-label, randomized, single-dose study with two treatment periods - before the surgery (Time 0 - T0) and 2 months after the bariatric surgery (Time 2 - T2). In each period, the obese volunteers received a single oral dose of amoxicillin 500 mg capsule (Amoxil®, GlaxoSmithKline Brazil Ltda.) with 200 mL water after an overnight fast (approximately 8 h). The subjects remained fasted for up to 3 h after taking the medication. Water and food restriction was held up to 3 h after the intake of the formulation. Standard meals were offered to all subjects. The volunteers who needed to use any medication (antihypertensive, antidiabetic and others) were instructed to use it 3 h after the intake of amoxicillin. Blood samples (6 mL) for determination of plasma concentration of amoxicillin were collected via a venous catheter into heparinized tubes at pre-dose (0 h), 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h post-dose. The plasma samples for chromatographic analysis were obtained by centrifugation (2000 g x 12 min at 4 ºC) of the blood samples. Plasma samples were stored at -20 °C until the analysis.\n\nAnthropometric parameters before and after surgery\n\nAt each visit (T0 and T2), the weight and height of all volunteers were measured, followed by the calculation of their body mass index (BMI) for anthropometric comparison before and after bariatric surgery. The body weight was measured using a digital scale, and the volunteers were wearing light clothes, barefoot, with empty pockets and without accessories. The height was measured using a stadiometer with 2 meters extension. The subjects were barefoot, with legs and feet parallel, weight distributed on both feet, arms relaxed at the side of the body and palms facing the body and head positioned on the Frankfurt plane.\n\nBariatric surgery procedure\n\nAll volunteers included in this trial were operated using the RYGB surgery technique, performed by the same surgical team, following a standardization for the alimentary loop size (1.20 m length) and the biliopancreatic loop (1 m length). The gastrojejunoanastomosis was calibrated by a Fouchet 32F probe, resulting in a diameter of 12 mm.\n\nAnalytical method\n\nAmoxicillin plasma concentration was quantified by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a liquid-liquid extraction.\n\nTo sample preparation, 100 µL of each plasma sample, 50 µL of the internal standard (IS) cephalexin (2.5 µg/mL) and 500 µL of acetonitrile (100 %) were added into a glass tube. The samples were vortexed (30 sec) and centrifuged (2000 g x 4 min at 4 ºC). The organic phase was transferred to another glass tube, which was added of 500 µL of deionized water and vortexed (10 sec). The samples were added of 10 mL of dichloromethane (100 %), vortexed (10 sec) and centrifuged (2000 g x 4 min at 4 ºC). The organic phase was transferred to the auto-injector PCR plates.\n\nThe high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent, Germany) consisted of a LC-10AD pump, autoinjector model CTC HST PAL/ 110695 and a G1316A/DE03018295 oven. The extracted solutions (10 µL) was injected into a 150 x 4.6 mm (5 μm particles) Inertsil ODS-C18 column maintained at 65 ◦C and the mobile phase was methanol/water (30/70, v/v) + 0.1 % formic acid at a flow rate of 900 μL/min with a split ratio of 1:3. The mass spectrometer used was a Quattro Micro (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with electrospray in positive mode for MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) to monitor the transitions 366.00 >348.90 and 348.00 >158.00 for amoxicillin and cephalexin, respectively.\n\nThe method validation was performed according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) bioanalytical method validation guidance [22] and the Brazilian National Sanitary Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) [23]. To evaluate the specificity of the method, eight different blank plasma lots (4 normal, 2 haemolysed and 2 lipemic) were tested for its interferences using the proposed extraction procedure and the chromatographic or spectroscopic conditions and compared with those obtained in the samples processed from the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ). The calibration curves were prepared by assaying standard plasma samples at eight concentrations of amoxicillin (20-5000 ng/mL) in triplicate and the linearity of each calibration curve was determined by plotting the peak area ratio (y) of amoxicillin/IS vs. nominal concentration of analyte. The calibration curve was constructed by weighted (1/x) least squares linear regression. The accuracy and precision of assay were evaluated by intra- and inter-assay studies. Seven aliquots of LLOQ and each quality control (QC) plasma samples (60, 850, 2500, 4000 and 12000 ng/mL) were run in three validation batches on three different days. Inter and intra-day precisions were determined as coefficient of variation, CV (%) = (SD/M) x 100 and the accuracy as the percentage relative error, RE (%) = [(E - T)/T] x 100, where M is the mean, SD is the standard deviation of M, E is the experimentally determined concentration and T is the theoretical concentration. The matrix effect experiments were performed using the ratio between amoxicillin (60 and 4000 ng/mL) and IS injected directly into the mobile phase and standard solutions added to blank plasma extracts (4 normal, 2 haemolysed and 2 lipemic). Each sample was obtained by a matrix factor normalized by IS (MFN) according to the following formula: MFN = (response of the analyte in matrix/internal standard response matrix)/(response of the analyte in solution/response of the internal standard solution). Stability QC plasma samples (60 and 4000 ng/mL) were subjected to short-term (6.0 h) room temperature, three freezes-thaw (-20 to 25 °C) cycles and 46.5 h autosampler (25 ºC) stability tests in triplicate. The stability results were compared with the nominal values.\n\nPharmacokinetic analysis\n\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained based on the plasma concentration vs. time curves analyzed by a non-compartmental model using the Phoenix WinNonlin® software, version 5.0 (Pharsight Corp, MoutainView, CA, USA). Values for the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (tmax) were obtained directly from the observed individual plasma concentration vs. time curves. The area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration was calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule. Elimination rate constant (ke) was obtained by log-linear regression analysis, and the elimination half-life (t1/2) was calculated with the equation [t1/2=ln(2)/ke].\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe quantitative variables (continuous and discrete) were initially analyzed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify the normality of the distribution. As this requirement was verified in most cases, mean and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for descriptive statistics. Parametric tests were used for analytical statistics.\n\nTo compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of the obese volunteers obtained before (T0) and after (T2) bariatric surgery, the t-test for paired data was used. The mean difference (or mean of differences) and their respective 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were also determined. Furthermore, the ratio between the parameter values verified before and after bariatric surgery was calculated, being expressed as geometric mean and its 95% CI. The degree and sign of the linear correlation between two variables were evaluated by the Pearson correlation coefficient, accompanied by its 95% CI.\n\nIn all analyses, two-tailed tests were used, establishing the level of significance at 0.05.

The potential for morbidity and mortality from perforation of the appendix necessitates prompt diagnosis.2 Acute appendicitis scoring systems such as pediatric appendicitis score (PAS) use elements of history, exam findings, and lab tests to identify patients at high risk of having acute appendicitis.3 Despite having limited use for this intent 4,5 these scores are often used to stratify patients by risk for continued observation, imaging or operative care. 6 While CT scans may have higher diagnostic yield, its use is not without risk. CT- related radiation exposure has been shown to increase cancer risk. There have been US first strategies published by the American College of Radiology7 and the American College of Emergency Physicians.8 However, nearly 50% of appendix US examinations are equivocal, which poses a dilemma for EM physicians and results in variation in clinical care.\n\nVarious strategies exist for the diagnostic approach to the patient after equivocal US with symptoms of AA. While select patients may be safely discharged based on clinical judgment,9 emergency providers often obtain CT or admit patients for clinical observation. In a study conducted by Garcia et al., they concluded that a protocol of US followed by CT in children with negative or equivocal US exam results in beneficial management as well as cost savings.10 In a study by Gregory et al., they concluded that a clinical decision rule followed by staged imaging was found to be the most cost-effective approach for diagnosis of AA in children.11 Bachur et al. integrated PAS score with US findings and concluded that patients with high risk (PAS 7-10) but negative US or low risk (PAS 0-3) benefit from serial exam or further work up. 12 The addition of US to the strategy reduced CT utilization.11 Standardized radiology reports have also been shown to reduce CT scans and admissions for observation.13 At a network of institutions nationwide a tool called the pediatric appendicitis risk calculator (pARC)1 is being studied to assess patient's true risk of appendicitis and provide guidance for clinical management to ER physicians.

The investigators have developed two evidence-based collaborative care interventions that use focused resources to assist primary care providers (PCPs) in meeting the two main challenges in managing care for patients on long-term opioid therapy (LTOT) with chronic pain (CP) and opioid use disorder (OUD)/misuse: 1) reassessment of LTOT and switch to medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) as indicated and 2) ready access to evidence-based behavioral pain treatment. Both interventions are entirely virtual and thus serve the needs of many underserved populations. Telemedicine Collaborative Management (TCM) features clinical pharmacists leading LTOT reassessment and buprenorphine (BUP) initiation in consultation with a BUP-prescribing physician. The TCM model is effective in decreasing pain interference, achieving LTOT dose reduction, BUP initiation and continuation, and shows greater patient engagement than the more resource intensive Integrated Pain Team comparator arm. Cooperative Pain Education and Self-Management (COPES), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program delivered via telehealth that improves pain interference, improves access to evidence-based behavioral pain treatment.\n\nWhile TCM and COPES are established interventions, the additional value of COPES-as a behavioral CP intervention paired with the pharmacologic-focused TCM for chronic pain and LTOT misuse/OUD--has not been tested.

ASUD in residential treatment are also at high risk of relapse, with follow-up studies suggesting that 60% of ASUD will relapse within 90 days of discharge. Parenting practices have been established as a key influence on adolescents' initiation and maintenance of substance use, as well as their substance use outcomes and likelihood of relapse. However, therapists who treat ASUD have reported a myriad of systemic barriers to engaging parents in treatment. Findings such as these deem ASUD in residential treatment a high priority population and argue for the value of easily accessible parenting interventions during this critical time. The proposed study evaluates a low cost, low intensity model for delivering parenting skills to parents preparing for their adolescent's discharge from residential substance use (SU) treatment. Specifically, this project involves adapting the delivery of a computerized parenting intervention (Parenting Wisely; PW) that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in improving parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems. This study adapts the delivery of PW for a new population (parents of ASUD) and new setting (residential treatment), and obtains initial data on its feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness. As a first step, an open trial with 10 parents was conducted to develop and pilot an adapted version of PW that included moderate engagement strategies: in-person coaching sessions, daily text messages containing reminders of parenting skills and links to video vignettes, and an online parent forum containing two networking boards (Ask an Expert and Connect with Parents). In the current phase, a pilot randomized trial with 60 parents will compare an adapted PW plus treatment as usual (TAU) condition (PW+) versus TAU only in a residential treatment center.

Specifically, this project adapts a computerized parenting intervention (Parenting Wisely; PW) that has preliminary evidence of efficacy in improving parenting skills and reducing youth behavior problems for a new population (parents of adolescents with SU) and new setting (residential treatment).\n\nParticipants: A minimum of 60 parent-adolescent dyads will be recruited from residential treatment. To guide design decisions for a larger trial, we made the decision after trial registration to recruit from one short-term residential treatment program and one long-term residential treatment program. Parental inclusion criteria: (1) be parent or legal guardian of an adolescent, aged 12-17 years; (2) had adolescent admitted to residential treatment due to problems related to substance use; (3) will be the primary guardian living with the adolescent immediately post-discharge; (4) willing to receive a parenting intervention; (5) fluent in English or Spanish; and (6) willing to provide written consent. Adolescents qualify if their parents meet these criteria as well as: (1) are fluent in English or Spanish and (2) willing to provide written assent. The only exclusion criteria are conditions that might preclude the adolescent's or parent's participation in a 2-3 hour interview (e.g., mania, psychosis, and cognitive impairment).\n\nStudy enrollment and randomization: Parents of all newly admitted adolescents will be screened for substance use and those screening positive, will receive a Consent to Contact (CoC) form. Parents that sign a CoC form will be contacted by research staff and invited in for a consent session.\n\nParents will provide written informed consent and adolescents will provide written assent in separate private rooms at the residential center. Parents and adolescents may choose to conduct the informed consent process and all study procedures in English or Spanish.\n\nParents will be given the choice whether to return for the baseline assessment or complete it following informed consent. Randomization will occur within 24 hours after the baseline assessment. Parent-adolescent dyads will be randomized by a blind research staff member to either treatment as usual or PW+ using urn randomization balanced on sex, frequency of substance use, and race/ethnicity. The evaluator will give parents condition assignments in sealed envelopes. If the parent is assigned to PW+, the evaluator will schedule the first coaching session. Coaching sessions were offered via multiple modalities to increase engagement: in-person, phone, or video conference.\n\nTherapist training, fidelity, and competence: Treatment will be delivered by Bachelor's or Master's-level parent coaches, at least one of whom is bilingual in English and Spanish. The study principal investigator (PI) will train the coaches. Coach therapeutic competence will be rated with six items that comprise the \"General Therapeutic Skills\" section of the Cognitive Therapy Rating Scale (CTRS). A score >24 is the criterion for competence. Study specific adherence checklists have been developed. The coaches will be required to earn a satisfactory consensus CTRS score of >24 and satisfactory adherence ratings (> 80% of elements) on two consecutive role plays to be assigned participants. All sessions will be rated for adherence and competence. A minimum of 25% of tapes will be double rated. The PI will meet weekly with the coaches for supervision focused on how to deliver PW+ with adherence and competence.\n\nTreatment as Usual (TAU): TAU is the standard treatment offered to all patients at the residential center. Adolescents receive about 25 hours of treatment per week with average length of stay 6-10 days at the short-term residential center and 30-45 days at the long-term residential center. Parents are typically offered 2 family therapy sessions. Adolescents receive 4-5 hours of individual and group therapy sessions per day, consisting of psychoeducation and general skills building. Medication management is offered as needed. Prior to discharge, parents also receive standard discharge planning, which consists of either a referral to a new outpatient therapy provider or return to a prior outpatient therapy provider.\n\nAdapted PW program: In addition to TAU , parents in the PW+ will receive: Parenting Wisely online modules, in-person coaching sessions, personalized text messages, and an expert-moderated online parent board.\n\nParenting Wisely online modules: Parenting Wisely (PW/Ser Padres Con Sabiduría) is a self-administered, interactive, multimedia online program. PW contains video vignettes of ten common family problems (e.g., adolescent substance use, curfews, household chores, monitoring of friends, sibling conflict, improving in school, getting up on time, sharing technology, etc.). For each problem, parents progress through three activities: viewing of a video clip of a family struggling with the problem; selection of one of three possible solutions to the problem; and receipt of feedback about the solution selected. Feedback is presented via a video enactment of the selected solution and an explanation of the solution's pros and cons. Goals of the feedback are to explain why ineffective solutions lead to problems and discuss how effective parenting solutions can prevent and resolve common family issues. Parents receive a parent workbook outlining all 10 vignettes, along with the potential problems and solutions. Parents create a unique login upon enrollment and can complete sessions at their own pace. PW typically takes 3-5 hours to complete.\n\nIndividual coaching sessions: Sessions individually tailor PW skills to each parent's presenting concerns, corresponding with four PW vignettes: substance use, limit setting, parental monitoring, and parental communication. The initial session is 60-75 min and consists of three sections: (1) rationale for parenting skills, (2) review of PW substance use module (in session), and (3) practice applying the skill to a current problem. Subsequent sessions follow the same outline and last 45-60 min, with active use of the PW program comprising about half the session. If parents introduce problems/complaints about their adolescent, the coach provides validation and discusses how to apply a pertinent PW skill.\n\nText-based messaging: Following discharge, parents will receive text messages daily for up to 24 weeks to: (a) reinforce PW skills, (b) motivate continued PW usage, and (c) encourage participation in the online parent message board.\n\nOnline parent board: Parents will be given access to a secure, expert-moderated website containing two networking forums (Ask an Expert, Connect with Parents). The website is accessible via a user-friendly smartphone application or \"app\" (similar to app versions of websites for sites such as Pinterest and Facebook). Parents will be able to submit questions anonymously using the same unique login as for the PW program. Questions posted on the message board will be answered by the research team within 48 hours. Answers to questions posted on the message board will direct parents to a specific PW module(s) most relevant to their parenting question. Participation on the message board will be encouraged for up to 24 weeks post-discharge.\n\nExit interviews: At each follow-up, parents complete exit interviews containing questions about each aspect of the intervention, including the in-person sessions (e.g., number, content, format), text messages (e.g., content, frequency, format), and online message board (e.g., ease of access, content, format). Parents will also complete the 16-item Consumer Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ), which rates their satisfaction with treatment delivery, their adolescent's treatment progress, and their ability to manage their adolescent's problems.\n\nAssessments: Follow-up assessments at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post-discharge will be conducted by an independent evaluator blind to condition. Assessments will be 1.5-2 hours. The primary and secondary outcomes are detailed in the Outcome section. Multiple steps will be taken to prevent attrition. First, multiple sources of contact information will be recorded for parents and adolescents. Follow-up reminders will be made via phone, text, and/or mail. The research team will meet weekly to review no-shows and outreach attempts, and discuss plans to connect with missing participants.\n\nData analysis plan: All 60 parents will be included in statistical analyses consistent with an intent-to-treat model. Prior to the main analyses, descriptive statistics will be run on key variables to examine distributional properties, identify outliers, and transform variables as needed. The treatment conditions will be compared on baseline demographic and clinical variables using basic two-group independent sample t-tests. Using a p < .05 criterion, significant pre-existing baseline differences between conditions will be controlled in subsequent analyses.\n\nAttrition analyses will compare follow-up completers and non-completers on baseline clinical and demographic variables to determine if they differ systematically. If no systematic differences are found between completers and non-completers, then missing data will be estimated using multiple imputation methods.\n\nOutcomes will be analyzed at 6, 12, and 24 weeks post baseline. Analyses will compare trajectories of use over the post-discharge period, controlling for baseline status as a covariate. For each dependent variable, separate repeated measures Analysis of Covariance will test the influence of condition, controlling for the following covariates: baseline status on the dependent variable, baseline differences between groups, and any mental health or substance use treatment received over the follow-up period. The effect of PW dosage on each dependent variable will be calculated and partial eta squared (η2) will be used to estimate the proportion of variance caused by PW. The primary analytical goal will be to provide measures of association and 95% confidence intervals to reveal the effect size of PW on each dependent variable. The goal of these analyses is to find promising trends to pursue in a larger fully powered trial.\n\nThe Primary Aim of the NIH-funded application that funded this study was to establish the feasibility and acceptability of the experimental intervention (Primary Aim 1: To examine the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted PW intervention that includes moderate engagement strategies for parents of adolescents with substance use disorders preparing for discharge from residential). The Secondary Aim of the NIH-funded study was to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the experimental intervention on adolescent substance use, adolescent high-risk behavior, and parenting behavior (Secondary Aims 2-4: To test the effectiveness of the adapted PW intervention + treatment as usual (PW+TAU) versus TAU only on: substance use outcomes, related high-risk behaviors, and parenting skills (the putative mediators of change).) Approximately midway through this study, with the support of the Program Officer, a second residential facility was added. This was to ensure that the study met its pre-specified recruitment targets, and also enabled us to test study procedures at one short-term residential facility and one-long term residential facility, to help inform the design of a future fully powered trial."],"EnrollmentCount":["122"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":497,"NCTId":["NCT02059772"],"OfficialTitle":["Evaluation of an Additional Therapeutic Approach to Diabetic Macular Edema by Combining Standard Therapy (Intravitreal Injection of a VEGF-inhibitor) With Micropulse Diode Laser Treatment in a Randomized, Controlled Proof of Concept Study"],"OverallStatus":["Unknown status"],"Phase":["Phase 4"],"BriefSummary":["The primary objective of this study is to evaluate if a combination therapy with micropulse diode laser treatment shows non inferiority on visual acuity within 12 months in comparison to standard therapy (intravitreal injection of ranibizumab only)."],"CollaboratorName":["Novartis"],"StartDate":["April 30, 2014"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2017"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["25"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":498,"NCTId":["NCT01453335"],"OfficialTitle":["Utilizing a Near Infrared Vein Visualization Device To Increase Peripheral Intravenous Access Targets in Pediatric & Adult Patients (% Venous Options)"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["VeinViewer® Vision will significantly increase the number of peripheral intravenous catheter access targets perceived by clinicians with experience in intravenous cannulation when compared to the number of access targets that these clinicians are able to visualize unaided or to palpate."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["June 2011"],"CompletionDate":["December 2011"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["300"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":499,"NCTId":["NCT00405769"],"OfficialTitle":["Alternative Lipid Lowering in Patients With Statin Intolerance: Use of Red Yeast Rice and Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes in a Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trial"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["This study will attempt to further validate a clinical treatment plan to lower LDL values using non-prescription supplements combined with a lifestyle change and education program which could represent an alternative approach to improve compliance in group of people who are unable to take traditional medication to lower cholesterol."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["January 2007"],"CompletionDate":["October 2007"],"DetailedDescription":["Up to 70 participants will be randomized into 2 groups.

Additionally, VHA has been at the forefront in the U.S. in promoting alternative therapies for pain, but these are not consistently available to Veterans in great need of them: those with chronic pain and harmful opioid use. VHA, through its Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, has made access to MOUD for all Veterans who need it a system-wide priority. However, successful implementation of complex care processes that face myriad barriers requires intentional, structured, evidence-based implementation efforts carried out by expert teams in close partnership with local leadership.\n\nAs such, the overarching goal of this project - the Consortium to Disseminate and Understand Implementation of Opioid Use Disorder Treatment (CONDUIT) -- is to unite six inter-related VISN/QUERI pilot Partnered Implementation Initiative projects in a concerted effort to improve access to MOUD among Veterans with OUD and access to alternative therapies for pain in 62 VHA sites spanning nine VISNs.

While guidelines recommend consideration of dose increase for patients not benefitting from opioid therapy, the rates of major harms are directly related to dose. Higher doses may also be more likely to precipitate opioid-induced hyperalgesia, a paradoxical increased pain response, in susceptible individuals. In summary, opioid dose increase, a currently accepted clinical response to poorly controlled pain, may offer little benefit and certainly increases risk, especially in patients already on moderate-high doses (30-100 mg daily morphine equivalents). Alternative treatment strategies to opioid dose escalation that lessen risk and possibly increase benefit are much needed.\n\nSwitching to buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX), a partial opioid agonist approved for use in the treatment of opioid abuse/dependence, may be a safe and effective alternative strategy to opioid dose escalation in the treatment of chronic pain. As a partial agonist, there is a ceiling to BUP/NX's respiratory depressant and other opioid-like effects, meaning it is less likely to cause addiction and overdose. Additionally, there are pre-clinical data to suggest BUP/NX is less likely to produce opioid-induced hyperalgesia and may even reverse it in patients switched from full agonist opioids. Case series have demonstrated improvements in pain, functional status and quality of life among patients switched from full agonist opioids to BUP/NX for chronic pain. Controlled trials are needed to establish BUP/NX's efficacy compared to opioid dose escalation in the treatment of poorly-controlled pain.\n\nThe investigators propose a pilot 12-week, open label randomized trial of BUP/NX compared to opioid dose escalation among patients with poorly-controlled pain on the primary outcome of pain intensity. As patient acceptance of either opioid dose escalation or BUP/NX is unknown, the investigators' first objective is to assess willingness to enroll in a randomized trial and reasons for and against enrollment among eligible patients. The study will compare treatments on the primary outcome of pain intensity, measured using the 11-point pain numerical rating scale, and secondary outcomes of pain interference, using the Brief Pain Inventory functional interference subscale, medication adherence and patient global assessment of change.

The investigators will compare the pathophysiological features of a functional test for subclinical CAD detection (exercise radionuclide perfusion SPECT) and an anatomical test to detect coronary calcification (ultrafast CT) in a high-risk asymptomatic population of 30 to 59 year old siblings of people with premature CAD. Siblings will undergo screening for occult CAD using both detection methods. Individuals who are abnormal on either test (exercise-induced ischemia or calcium score greater than 75th percentile for age and sex) will be offered cardiac catheterization, which will include quantitative coronary angiography, assessment of endothelial function by intracoronary acetylcholine, and measurement of plaque volume and composition in a selected coronary artery by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The study will focus on the pathophysiology of occult CAD among individuals who have exercise ischemia with low calcium scores and other individuals who have high calcium scores without ischemia. Discrepancies between these two tests measure potentially different biological pathways and such discrepancies are observed frequently in high-risk asymptomatic siblings (40% in our recent pilot study). Analyses will be done to determine which biological risk factors can account for variation in plaque calcification that results in discordances between these two measures of occult disease (including lipid levels and subclasses, Lp(a), diabetes, thrombotic factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and importantly, those factors involved in calcium regulation, and bone regulatory proteins). In those siblings undergoing cardiac catheterization, analyses will be done to determine whether the severity or extent of coronary luminal narrowing, the presence of epicardial or microvascular endothelial dysfunction, or the volume or calcium content of plaque by IVUS can account for discordances between the two screening tests. Polymorphisms in several candidate genes that may affect tissue calcification will be examined as a possible explanation for variations in plaque calcification as reflected in test discordance. Plasma and DNA will also be collected for novel studies of factors that may account for variability in coronary plaque calcification in this unique well characterized asymptomatic high risk population.

Furthermore, with the introduction of bevacizumab, there are new options for a maintenance treatment which should be evaluated.\n\nAs the continuation of chemotherapy plus bevacizumab until disease progression has to be regarded as standard of care, the question is whether a de-escalation of treatment intensity or even withdrawal of treatment (\"drug holiday\") after a certain treatment period will not be inferior with respect to resulting time with tumor control, but allow patients a period with less toxicity and gain of quality of life."],"EnrollmentCount":["853"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":522,"NCTId":["NCT03179059"],"OfficialTitle":["Resolution of Uncertainty Through Testing: The Impact of Pregnancy Tests on Reproductive and Maternal Health Beliefs and Behaviors in Uganda"],"OverallStatus":["Terminated"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Given the high rate of delayed adoption of antenatal care (ANC), and high rates of unintended pregnancy and unsafe abortion in Uganda, research on the period of time before confirmation of pregnancy is critical to understand underlying beliefs that guide behaviors ultimately important for maternal and neonatal health (UDHS, 2011; Hussain, 2013).\n\nHome pregnancy tests - which now cost less than 10 cents each - have the potential to facilitate FP uptake and significantly improve reproductive, maternal and child health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda.

Violent victimization among youth includes mental health sequelae in addition to the physical injury caused by violent behavior, with the heaviest burden on non-white youth. Homicide is the leading cause of death for 10-24 year old African Americans and one of the top 3 causes of death for Hispanic and Native American youth. Racism, the exercise of power against a racial group defined as inferior, is associated with aggression and violence against racial minority youth. Researchers have identified two pathways by which racism affects youth violence: 1) as a stressor leading to violence; and 2) as a structural factor resulting in more exposure to community-level risk factors. Racial prejudice may also increase interracial mistrust, hostility, and violence. Yet, strategies that integrate undoing racism with violence prevention that also engage youth in change efforts have not been studied systematically.\n\nPositive development can be achieved by engaging youth in community improvement activities designed to empower them to avoid risky behaviors. Building on prior research and guided by previous studies of empowerment processes, the investigators developed an afterschool violence prevention program for middle-school students called Youth Empowerment Solutions (YES) for Peaceful Communities. Prior studies have described how YES engages youth in assessing neighborhood assets and liabilities for violence prevention and designing and implementing neighborhood or school projects to reduce violence. Results from prior YES evaluations found the YES program reduced violent behavior and increased positive behaviors in a comparison group design through the process of empowering youth to think critically about their community, develop plans for change, and implement their plans (i.e., program effects were mediated through empowered outcomes).\n\nThe existing YES curriculum was adapted to empower youth from diverse backgrounds to address racism and discrimination as a way to reduce violent behavior. YES for Engaging youth for anti-Racism And Cultural Equity (YES-ERACE) focuses on middle school students because this is a developmental period when racial identity development becomes a central developmental task, awareness of racism develops, ideas about interpersonal relationships are formative, and bullying behavior is at its peak. Empowering youth to address racial prejudice and racist behaviors may, in part, contribute to reductions in violent behaviors. Working with an Advisory Board involved in undoing racism work, the investigators modified the existing YES curriculum to integrate the Teaching Tolerance (TT) curriculum from the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the oldest civil rights organizations in the U.S. A unique feature of YES-ERACE is that youth design and implement projects with a focus on undoing racism or discrimination.\n\nThe study includes two phases: 1) adapting YES and 2) testing YES-ERACE effects. Phase 1 included piloting and evaluating curriculum revisions through testing new modules and obtaining feedback from youth and teachers. Phase 2 tests the effects of YES-ERACE using a group-randomized trial in after-school programs across 6 middle schools. The investigators examine the effects of the curriculum on individual youths' sense of empowerment, racism attitudes, and violent behavior.

Within each mexiletine period, treatment dosage of mexiletine will be built up from 200 mg 1 time a day PO on the first day of the first week, to 200 mg 2 times a day on the second day of the first week, to the desired dosage of 200 mg 3 times a day PO on the third day of the first week and throughout the remaining days of the 4-week treatment period. A similar build-up scheme will be used within each placebo period.\n\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome measure for this study is a decrease in the most prominent clinical symptom: stiffness. Stiffness will be quantified by an Interactive Voice Response System (IVR) in which the patient will rate their mean daily IVR participant-assessed severity of stiffness on an ordinal scale (1-9). The secondary outcome measures will include changes in pain, weakness, and fatigue on IVR, Individual Neuromuscular Quality of Life (INQoL), the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) a patient-reported survey of patient health, blood plasma levels of mexiletine, clinical myotonia assessments, quantitative handgrip myotonia, biceps force test and needle-electromyography (EMG).\n\nNature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: In the screening phase, electrocardiography (ECG) and EMG recordings, laboratory values and baseline blood plasma levels of mexiletine will be tested.

Patients will be asked to visit the department of Neurology between 4-16 visits (depending on number of treatment sets necessary to obtain enough evidence) during the study enrolment. Each visit will approximately cost 2 hours; within each visit two questionnaires (INQoL, SF-36) need to be filled, blood plasma levels of mexiletine will be measured and clinical and electrophysiological myotonia tests need to be performed. Furthermore, an ECG and EMG will be recorded at the end of each treatment or placebo period.

In ALS, SMA, LGMD and Pompe disease, SDB is usually caused by nocturnal alveolar hypoventilaton due to diaphragmatic weakness which manifests first during sleep and REM sleep in particular. SDB usually leads to sleep disruption, non-restorative sleep and daytime symptoms including morning headache, hypersomnolence, and increased neuromuscular fatigue. In patients with severe diaphragmatic involvement both symptoms of SDB and potential complications of respiratory muscle weakness substantially add to overall disease burden of the disease and decrease life span. Diagnosis of SDB is established by means of sleep studies which should ideally comprise polysomnography (PSG) and transcutaneous capnography. PSG with capnometry is time-consuming, expensive and not readily available for patients or referring physicians, respectively. For this reason it is desirable to thoroughly screen patients with neuromuscular disease for symptoms of SDB and respiratory muscle weakness. Results from a validated screening questionnaire could be used as an adjunctive to pulmonary function testing or spirometry results in order to identify patients in whom sleep studies should be performed. In addition, a screening questionnaire would facilitate early recognition of patients with SDB, enabling treating physicians to take appropriate steps to establish the diagnosis and to initiate non-invasive ventilation as early as possible.\n\nUntil now, there is no validated German language screening questionnaire for symptoms of respiratory muscle weakness and SDB. Steier et al. published an English language questionnaire which was validated as a screening tool in 33 patients with very different neuromuscular disorders which were predominantly neurogenic (Steier et al. 2011). In this study, SDB was defined by an apnea hypopnea index above 5 per hour. Nocturnal oxygen saturation and CO2 monitoring were not taken into account at all. In addition the questionnaire does not systematically cover sleep-related symptoms of SDB in detail (such as sleep disruption and morning headache) which have to be separated from daytime symptoms such as dyspnea or orthopnea, respectively.\n\nThus, the current project aims to correlate comprehensively generated items of a screening questionnaire with sleep study results including capnography alongside with respiratory muscle testing in patients with neuromuscular disorders. As control subjects, patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and sleep disorders other than sleep-related breathing disorders are enrolled in the study."],"EnrollmentCount":["90"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":569,"NCTId":["NCT04619407"],"OfficialTitle":["Screening for SARS-CoV-2-Infections in Teachers, Childcare Educators, Pupils and Preschoolers in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["The main objectives of this study are\n\nto establish the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in schools and kindergartens in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in autumn and winter 2020/2021\nto monitor the future spread of the disease by assessing serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 in teachers and childcare educators over time"],"CollaboratorName":["Ministry of Education, Science and Culture of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern","Ministry of Social Affairs, Integration and Equality of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern","State Office for Health and Social Affairs of the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern"],"StartDate":["November 4, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["March 26, 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["Detailed Description:\n\nThis study aims to collect information on teachers and childcare educators as well as on pupils and preschoolers in the State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern\n\nOver a 5 month period, 5 study visits per participant are planned.

Unfortunately, a large proportion of individuals with eating disorders do not receive treatment, and of those who do receive treatment, only approximately 40-50% of clients are symptom-free at the end of treatment. In addition to limited efficacy, existing treatments can be time-consuming and costly. From both public health and humanitarian perspectives it is best to prevent eating disorders prior to their emergence.\n\nThis study will use a randomized, controlled design to investigate the effects of a cognitive dissonance-based intervention on attentional biases for weight words in body-dissatisfied women. Cognitive dissonance is thought to occur when there is a discrepancy between one's beliefs or attitudes, and behaviour. The experience of dissonance is thought to create discomfort, and resultantly individuals change their beliefs to be in line with their behaviours. Thus, the core tenet of cognitive dissonance-based interventions is the concept of engaging participants in counter-attitudinal behaviours (e.g., speaking out against the thin ideal) to enact change through cognitive dissonance. This cognitive dissonance-based intervention (The Body Project) targets body dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, and eating disorder symptoms.\n\nAlmost all research on the Body Project has assessed its efficacy via self-report, however, this study will use an eye-tracker to measure the gaze. Attentional biases are less susceptible to self-reporting biases than traditional pencil-and-paper questionnaires and so are a more reliable measure of cognitive processing The participants in this study will be placed into one of three different conditions: cognitive dissonance (CD), media psychoeducation (MP), or waitlist control (WL), and a similar number of women will be allocated to the body-satisfied (BS) condition. Both the CD and MP intervention groups will consist of two approximately 2-hour sessions scheduled one week apart, as well as a 30-minute online follow-up questionnaire 1 month after the second intervention/assessment session. Individuals allocated to WL will begin to receive the intervention approximately 5 weeks after the CD and MP groups (after their 1 month follow-up survey). The BS group will consist of two approximately 35- to 40-minute assessment-only sessions scheduled one week apart.\n\nAll groups of participants will full out several self-report questionnaire as well as participate in a brief eye-tracking assessment both before and after their allocated intervention group (the BS condition and waitlist control will only complete the questionnaires and eye tracking assessment). Participants will sign up for a group time slot, and the group time slots will be randomly assigned to be given either the CD, and MP, or the WL condition.\n\nParticipants will be recruited through the University of Calgary Department of Psychology Research Participation System (RPS) as well as campus community participants recruited through campus advertisements.

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE\n\nCongenital heart disease (CHD)is one of the most common congenital malformations and is associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Acquired heart diseases are also common and have significant impact on the health of the young. As the therapeutic strategies are evolving, reliable non-invasive methods to image the cardiovascular system and quantitatively assess cardiac function with accuracy and reproducibility are pivotal to define the natural history, to evaluate the results of intervention and to assess long-term outcome.Three-dimensional echocardiography (3-DE) has important clinical applications to CHD. Because of growth throughout childhood,interpretation of these measurements requires normalization of the dimensions of cardiac structures to the size of the body. This is commonly done by the calculation of Z scores for the measurement of interest. Currently available normative data in the medical literature are limited to one-dimensional and two-dimensional echocardiography measurements only.\n\nIn this study, we will generate normative data of the 3-DE measurements for cardiac structure and function in a large cohort of healthy infants, children,and adolescents. We will also investigate the utility of 3DE for assessing the cardiovascular structures and cardiac function for congenital and acquired heart disease.\n\nIII. DESIGN AND METHODS\n\nA. Subjects:\n\nA total of 800 study subjects will be enrolled in the study after approval by the Institutional Review Board. Echocardiography data will be prospectively collected. The subjects will be divided into 5 groups:\n\nGroup 1. (n=300) Patients with normal cardiac anatomy and function by echocardiography.\n\nGroup 2. (n=300) Patients with various congenital heart diseases.\n\nGroup 3. (n=100) Patients with sickle cell disease and at risk for ventricular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension.\n\nGroup 4. (n=50) Patients with Duchenne and muscular dystrophy at risk for ventricular remodeling and dysfunction.\n\nGroup 5. (n=50) Patients with Marfan syndrome or the aortic disease.\n\nB. Procedure:\n\nBefore the study, heart rate and blood pressures will be obtained for each study subject. The subjects will be placed in a left recumbent position and ECG attached. After a complete conventional echocardiographic assessment of each subject, real-time 3-DE /Doppler study will be performed with 3-DE system. The 3-DE study will take about 30 minutes. After each study, all data will be saved and processed off line. Indication for the clinical echocardiogram will include cardiac murmur, syncope or chest pain but with a normal echocardiogram. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient and legal representatives after a full explanation of the procedure.\n\nConventional echocardiography All patients will undergo a complete 2- dimensional, color flow Doppler, and spectral Doppler examination. Examination will be performed using a commercially available ultrasound system (IE33 system, Philips, Andover, Mass). All measurements will be made offline using a computer workstation(Xcelera,Philips Medical Systems,Andover,MA). All measurements will be made according to American Society of Echocardiography protocol. For any given structure, measurement will be made if excellent and unambiguous views were available.\nTransthoracic 3-DE The 3-DE/Doppler studies will be performed using the IE33 (Philips, Andover, MA,USA) ultrasound machine with X3-1 or X7-2 matrix-array transducers. The X7-2 matrix-array transducer is a new tool and particularly well suited for small children. The patient will be in a decubitus position. Image acquisition will be performed from an apical window with the LV as the region of interest based on international recommendations. To encompass the complete LV into the 3D dataset, a full volume scan will acquire in harmonic mode from four R-wave triggered subvolumes. This scan will carried out during an end-expiratory breath hold a few seconds when possible. The 3D dataset will be stored in a DICOM format on a CD-ROM and transferred to separate workstations for off-line data analysis.\n\nC. Image off-line analysis\n\nQLAB Semiautomated Border Detection Method:A semiautomated border detection biplane LV volume analysis was performed using off-line QLAB version 8.0 software (Philips). The LV end-diastolic volume (EDV) and end-systolic volume (ESV) (smallest LV volume) frames are identified.On both of these end-diastolic and end-systolic frames,five identification points are marked: the septal, lateral, anterior, and inferior mitral annulus and the apex (from either one of the views). Then the software automatically delineates the LV endocardial border and, by sequential analysis, creates a LV mathematical model or \"cast\" that represents the LV cavity.\nTomTec Semiautomated Method:LV volume analysis will be performed off-line using TomTec 4D LV-Analysis software. TomTec requires triplane manual tracing of the endocardial border after which the software selects a fitting geometric model and the total LV endocardial border is automatically delineated with possible manual corrections. Based on the six initial contours, a spatiotemporal interpolation model (like a pulsating balloon) is created by rotational and temporal interpolation of these contours. According to the initial balloon, the algorithm starts to detect the endocardial border continuously in the entire 4D dataset (without large gaps due to interpolation), like deforming the balloon in the LV until it best fits the walls in each frame. Adjustments can be made manually after this step in oblique, sagittal, and coronal planes. Subsequently, a final reconstruction of the LV model and a time-volume curve are created. LV-EDV and LV-ESV are the largest and smallest volume, respectively, from this time-volume curve.\n\nD. Data Analysis\n\nAll numerical values are expressed as mean +/- standard deviation. The real- time 3-DE measurements will be compared with other clinical data and measurements, such as cardiac catheterization or magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical significance will be defined as P<0.05. All statistical analyzes will be done using SAS for Windows version9.1 and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2007) for all analysis."],"EnrollmentCount":["0"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":579,"NCTId":["NCT01830270"],"OfficialTitle":["Preoperative Chemotherapy With Weekly Cisplatin, Epirubicin and Paclitaxel (Intensified PET) in Patients With Locally Gastric Cancer : a Phase II Proof-of-concept Study."],"OverallStatus":["Terminated"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["If surgery remains the main treatment for gastric cancer without distant metastases; perioperative-chemotherapy increased the likelihood of progression free survival.

Towards these aims, this study will integrate four sources of data: (a) individual differences thought to relate to craving; (b) neural responses to cognitive tasks and behavioral (e.g., Facial Action Coding System measures) reactions to OC sampling; (c) fMRI and behavioral responses to post-smoking cue OC exposure; and (d) EMA data related to craving and smoking. The investigators will embed findings within neurobehavioral addiction theories (dual-systems, iRISA) and will try to identify individuals who may benefit most from OC-based interventions. Most of the study procedures are observational in that they are intended to measure without influencing any health-related outcome. One study procedure meets the revised NIH guidelines for an intervention, in that craving, behavior, and brain activity are measured while participants are presented with either a pleasant or a neutral (blank) olfactory cue in a between-subjects design. The details of study procedures are outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\nOverview Data will be collected over a series of three laboratory sessions. Nicotine-deprived smokers with varying levels of interest in quitting will sample a set of OCs. Participants will be exposed to smoking cues to induce peak cravings and then receive one of the previous OCs (randomly assigned to either a pleasant or neutral OC). This study will use a between-subjects design in which participants will complete several tasks during two experimental sessions, with some tasks better suited to the behavioral and others to the fMRI session. A week-long EMA protocol will follow, within which the effect of OCs on craving and smoking will be assessed. All participants will complete all study procedures.\n\nProcedures The first study contact includes a telephone screening to assess preliminary inclusion and exclusion criteria, including major MRI-related exclusion criteria such as metal in the body. Eligible and interested participants will then visit the lab to complete an approximately 1-hour visit that includes a standardized assessment. Data collected during this visit will be used primarily to characterize the sample.\n\nIn both of the following experimental visits, participants will complete a series of common procedures. First, participants will be asked to abstain from smoking for at least 8-hrs prior to each visit. To ensure abstinence, participants will report when they last used nicotine and record carbon monoxide (CO). Participants will also present their cigarette pack and lighter, and complete a brief assessment of baseline craving and mood with standard measures used in the Principal Investigator's prior work. Additionally, participants undergo an odor sampling procedure. They will be asked to sniff 8 OCs; after each one, they will provide via structured interview ratings of pleasantness, intensity, familiarity, evoked emotions, mood, and report any associations or memories to the OC. OC presentation order is randomized. Participants will then undergo a cigarette cue exposure to induce peak cravings. Participants in the pleasant OC condition will then sniff an OC they rated as pleasant, while those randomized to the neutral condition will receive an odor blank. Outside of these procedures, the two experimental sessions differ.\n\nThe first experimental session will occur within approximately 1-week (potentially more depending on scanner availability) of the screening session and will include a roughly 60-minute fMRI scan. The first part of the scan will involve structural, resting state, and task-based data collection (e.g., Go/No-Go to assess response inhibition; cigarette cue exposure). This will allow for identification of individually specified cognitive brain states linked to addiction-related processes (i.e., neural fingerprints). Then, neural activity (BOLD) and functional and effective connectivity for identified regions of interest (ROI) will be measured during a smoking cue exposure manipulation (to induce craving) followed by olfactory cue administration. These data will be used to examine the disruption of the craving brain state by the pleasant, compared to the neutral, olfactory cue.\n\nIn the second experimental session, participants will undergo a series of behavioral tasks. This again includes a smoking cue exposure manipulation followed by administration of either the pleasant or neutral olfactory cue. To examine the impact of pleasant vs. neutral OCs on craving, participants will provide urge ratings and behavioral measures of urge (i.e., craving as measured through a pressure-sensitive squeeze device, and facial affect) throughout this procedure. Behavioral measures of affect will also be collected during the OC sampling procedure to allow for an examination of how emotional responses to pleasant olfactory cues mediate the impact of olfactory cues on craving.\n\nThe final study procedure involves a 7-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol in which participants will monitor their cigarette cravings and the investigators will collect pilot data to assess how well pleasant vs. neutral olfactory stimuli will control these real-life cravings.\n\nThe primary outcomes of interest throughout these experimental sessions involve the impact of pleasant vs. neutral olfactory cues (i.e., odor blanks) on urge to smoke. The investigators are also interested in determining if the patterns of neural activation during smoking cue exposure and during olfactory cue exposure are more similar for those randomized to the neutral OC condition than to the pleasant OC condition. Briefly, analyses will include representational similarity analysis, in which the similarity of activity patterns (neural fingerprints) for different brain states (craving, post-cigarette cue odor) in each subject, is measured through Pearson correlation. Brain states are represented by the pattern of beta coefficients across the 89 atlas regions that underlie each phase of the fMRI session (e.g., while the subject is holding a cigarette to induce craving). These patterns are correlated with each other (giving one Fisher-Z transformed r coefficient per subject), and the resulting correlation coefficients are compared in a group analysis that tests for a statistically significant difference between the pleasant odor group and the neutral/odor blank group. Secondary outcomes of interest include equivalent analyses that calculate the similarity between the post-cigarette cue odor-induced brain state with brain states observed for each of the behavioral tasks completed in the fMRI ( i.e., N-back, Posner Cueing, Delay Discounting, Go/No-Go) in order to quantify and statistically contrast the relative presence of key cognitive and affective processes."],"EnrollmentCount":["250"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Basic Science"]},{"Rank":583,"NCTId":["NCT04546477"],"OfficialTitle":["Prospective, Multicenter, Post-market, Single Arm Study to Confirm the Performance of the RenzanTM Peripheral Stent System in Treating Superficial Femoral and/or Popliteal Artery Disease"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["The primary objective of this study is to confirm the safety and efficacy of the RenzanTM Peripheral Stent System when used for treatment of superficial femoral (SFA) and/or popliteal (POP) artery disease.\n\nThis trial plans to include 135 patients in (up to) 10 locations around in Europe."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["July 30, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["July 31, 2025"],"DetailedDescription":["PRIZER Study is a prospective, multicenter, post-market, single arm study with plan to include approximately 135 patients eligible to be treated with RenzanTM Peripheral Stent System stratified in 2 groups: 90 FEM-POP patients (From superficial femoral Artery to the Proximal edge of patella) and 45 Isolated POP patients (From Hunter's canal to the Origin of anterior tibial artery).\n\nThe sponsor will work in accordance with standard operating procedures (SOP) and the Monitoring Plan in order to ensure adherence to the CIP and applicable regulations at the investigational sites.\n\nThe Monitoring Plan is built according to a risk-based monitoring approach and describes the level of source data verification to be performed by the monitors.\n\nRisk-based monitoring approach uses all available means to supervise the trial (central monitoring, remote monitoring and on-site monitoring), focusing in critical data points and issues ensuring that adequate monitoring (central, remote and on-site) at each site is completed to ensure protection of the rights and safety of the subjects and the quality and integrity of the data collected and submitted.\n\nThe sponsor shall provide training and the necessary guidelines to assist each investigational site on the data collection in the eCRF.

We hypothesize that patients with symptomatic HF, LVEF ≤35%, without left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis on LGE-CMR, will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation. If our hypothesis is confirmed, this could provide evidence for the management of these patients with a significant impact on common daily praxis and health care expenditures.\n\nClinical hypothesis:\n\nPatients with symptomatic HF, with LVEF ≤35% and without LV mid-wall fibrosis on late gadolinium enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), will not benefit from CRT-D implantation compared with CRT-P only implantation.\n\nEstimated number of patients needed to be screened and randomized:\n\n600 patients are needed to be randomized according to the study power analysis. Since 35 % of patients are estimated to be LG-E positive and thus excluded from randomization, 924 patients are needed to be screened.\n\nPre-screening:\n\nPatients with non-ischemic HF visiting an out-patient department and possibly eligible for the trial will have their pharmacotherapy optimized. A screening visit in an out-patient department will be scheduled in 1-2 months after pharmacotherapy optimization since the qualifying LVEF and NT-proBNP level has to be measured after a maximal tolerated pharmacotherapy of heart failure has been achieved.\n\nScreening:\n\nAfter the signing of informed consent, screening examination will be performed. The informed consent will be obtained by attending physician in every center and a signed original will be stored in each individual center for the whole duration of the study. The screening examination will include medical history, documentation of underlying cardiac disease. The following co-morbidities will be specifically documented: peripheral arterial disease, cerebral vascular disease, pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, sleep apnea, tobacco use, and any malignant disease within the last 5 years. Physical exam with vital signs, NYHA functional class, pulse rate, resting blood pressure will be performed. Cardiovascular pharmacological treatment will be documented. Standard laboratory parameters are recorded, including creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, liver tests, TSH, NT-proBNP. Transthoracic echocardiography will be done to confirm LVEF ≤35% using biplane Simpson's method. Documented will be LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters and volumes, thickness of ventricular septum and LV posterior wall, stroke volume, cardiac output, indexed left atrial volume, presence and grade of valvular heart disease, right ventricle diameter, TAPSE, presence and grade of pulmonary hypertension. Selective coronarography will be performed if it was not done before to exclude patients with a severe coronary heart disease. LGE-CMR imaging will be performed by an operator blinded to all other clinical data to evaluate left ventricular mid-wall fibrosis.\n\nPatients with a significant amount of fibrosis will be excluded from the study and treated according to local practice with an emphasis on ICD implantation to prevent SCD.\n\nRandomization:\n\nAfter fulfilling all eligibility criteria, including maximally tolerated pharmacotherapy, subjects will be randomized by the physicians who enrolled them in a 1:1 ratio to receive CRT-D or CRT-P implantation. Randomization will be carried out by physicians enrolling patients through a stand-alone web-based CRF managed by an independent biomedicine and statistics center, independent on all randomizing personnel. The web-CRF-based allocation sequence will be based on computer-generated random numbers and will be concealed until the type of intervention is assigned.\n\nTreatment:\n\nAfter randomization, devices will be implanted as soon as possible (within 2 weeks). The ICD will be programmed with anti-tachycardia pacing and shock therapy as per common praxis.\n\nFollow-up:\n\nAll patients will be followed-up for at least 3 years after the implantation. After the implantation, all patients will be examined every 6 months in an out-patient department with the assessment of medical history, vital signs, physical exam, and NT-proBNP as in the screening visit. A device control will be performed every 6 months.\n\nAfter device implantation the concomitant care and all possible concomitant interventions will be carried out as per common praxis.\n\nPatients will be evaluated for possible end-points. Deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure, stroke or arrhythmias will be recorded throughout the study duration.\n\nQuality of life (QoL) is assessed at baseline and annually during follow-up. Patients will fill out the SF-36 Questionnaire for general QoL, the MacNew Questionnaire for disease specific QoL.\n\nAn Endpoint Classification Committee will adjudicate hospitalizations and deaths for causality. An independent Data Monitoring Committee will periodically review mortality data throughout the study.\n\nFor safety reasons, all patients will be followed using a daily ECG monitoring and analysis. ECG from the Home-monitoring units will be evaluated in a dedicated center. This center will evaluate the ECGs sent from the Home-monitoring units with respect to patient safety and the study end-points. If the Home-monitoring unit reveals any rhythm disturbance they will contact the patient's physician and make a record in the CRF. If a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia is documented on a Home-monitoring in a CRT-P patient, a decision will be made and documented about a possible crossover to CRT-D as soon as possible.\n\nPatients who will deviate from intervention protocols (e.g. crossover to CRT-D implantation) will continue to be followed-up.\n\nBlinding:\n\nTrial participants will be blinded to the device type for the whole duration of the trial.\n\nThe randomizing and implanting physicians will not be blinded to the type of the device. These physicians will not take care in the subsequent patients' follow-up and sign a declaration of confidentiality.\n\nThe same will be true for the physicians / technicians attending to the device interrogation during follow-up visits. The device type will be hidden and physicians will sign a declaration of confidentiality. The patients' documentation will not reveal the device type.\n\nA maximum effort will be done to hide the type of the implanted device. The implantation will be intramuscular and the device interrogation follow-up visits will not reveal the device type.\n\nThe physicians attending the follow-up visits and entering all patients' data into web-based CRF will be blinded to the implanted device type.\n\nIn case of an emergency with a need to reveal the type of the device, i.e. lead fracture, infection in the place of implantation, ventricular tachycardia, the site principal investigator will decide to unblind the patient.

In the investigators previous study the investigators obtained good results with an organ saving treatment. Although the mortality and morbidity associated with radical surgery is avoided, the irradiated rectum remains in situ, possibly causing functional problems.\n\nThe primary objective is to describe the functional outcome of patients that choose for organ saving treatment.

This has led to extensive changes in the therapy processes, including a reduction in group sizes and maintaining distances within the groups, resulting in a reduction in the range of therapies available to individuals, since the number of employees remains unchanged and cannot be increased at will and in the short term due to the lack of qualified staff. In order for the treatment/rehabilitation goals to be achieved nonetheless, new forms of implementation of therapy programs must be developed in addition to organizational adjustments. Digitalization can be a significant support in this respect. The majority of patients in psychosomatic rehabilitation possess smartphones, meaning that the necessary infrastructure for the utilization of digital offers is available and can be used to the greatest possible extent. The use of digital measures within the therapeutic services supports the independence of the patients, as they can use the digital offers independently and flexibly in their own time.\n\nHow should Health care/rehabilitation services be designed in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and which services have the potential to buffer future crises: What general recommendations can be derived for the design of such services for routine care? What are support measures to encourage social participation and return to work?"],"CollaboratorName":["Dr. Becker Hospital Group","Dr. Becker Burg-Klinik (Burg)","Dr. Becker Klinik Norddeich (NOR)","Dr. Becker Klinik Juliana (JUL)","Dr. Becker Klinik Möhnesee"],"StartDate":["July 1, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2022"],"DetailedDescription":["In Germany, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a crisis with massive effects on health and rehabilitation care. This crisis is not a short-term event but will also has longer-term effects on health care service/rehabilitation. Necessary adjustments due to hygiene and distance regulations include, for example, the reduction of group sizes and alternatives to conventional service provision (= digital services, McNeary et al., 2020). How such offers are perceived and accepted by patients and staff is crucial for the effect on the care. Systematic research into the pandemic from the patient and employee perspective, its consequences for procedures in rehabilitation clinics and for the implementation of the necessary therapies is required in a timely manner in order to better understand and mitigate the effects of the pandemic and to ensure the effectiveness of rehabilitation. This is the aim of this project with a focus on digital services and their subjective usefulness.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of such offers can mean that a therapist is not present during the entire therapy, but that rehabilitants first learn the basics of a topic in self-study. This is based on the principle of the \"Flipped Classroom\". (Rehab) Patients as well as employees of the clinics are involved in the piloting of the survey instruments and the final choice of outcome criteria as well as the derivation of possible applications (guidelines, recommendations for rehabilitants).\n\nIn addition, the pandemic is negatively associated with equal participation of vulnerable groups (e.g. persons with physical or psychological handicaps). In the case of medical rehabilitation patients, particular occupational problems make equal participation and social cohesion more difficult: problems such as long-term limited productivity or the threat of exclusion from the labor market (pension for reduced earning capacity), negative employment forecasts and experiences of previously limited social participation are in turn further exacerbated by demographic change and the consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic. These restrictions are also reflected in the increased experience of loneliness. To date, however, there is a lack of a systematic understanding of these circular, dynamic processes and low-threshold, effective approaches to action, effective approaches to action.\n\nThe following questions will be empirically investigated:\n\nHow are digital services evaluated regarding feasibility, acceptance and subjective usefulness in light of the current situation?\nWhich characteristics of rehabilitants are related to the acceptance and subjective usefulness of digital offers?\nFor which patients of rehabilitation is there a need for support in the use of digital services to achieve rehabilitation goals?\nAre there differences in perceived usefulness between services?\nHow do people in the welfare state and labor market with disabilities and impairments (rehabilitants) perceive the consequences of the Covid 19 pandemic and the transformation processes?\nHow effective are support measures with regard to communication for rehabilitants in supporting equal participation?\nHow should support for equal participation be designed in the long term: What What are the consequences for labor market and social policy?\n\nThe methodology uses a natural variation design within the Dr. Becker Clinical Group in order to investigate the issues at the highest possible scientific level and to achieve reliable results. The interventions consist of an online depression session as a \"flipped classroom\" and/or an online lecture with socio-medical content, and/ or a tobacco cessation lecture, which are combined in such a way that the differential effects can be evaluated. For this purpose, a control group is included that does not participate in these interventions (but receives the standard rehabilitation treatment programm). Furthermore, all groups voluntarily receive patient training before rehabilitation with the content of setting \"treatment goals\" as well as an invitation to pre- and post-surveys.\n\nThe survey methods are online surveys (before the treatment=pre (T1); end of treatment=post (T2); end of treatment=post 12 weeks (T3)) by means of UniPark.\n\nThe main target variables are reported behavior and well-being (stress/burden of COVID-19 disease or probability of disease, limitations, quality of life, anxiety or depression; pre-post comparison) as well as subjective need (pre) and benefit (post) of the digital services. Further primary target variables are concentrated on social participation, workability and return to work. The theoretical foundation for the selection of target variables and constructs is the Carry-Over Action Model. The sample includes all rehabilitands who undergo a psychosomatic rehabilitation in the hospitals. The planned sample size of the rehabilitants is N = 2,000.\n\nThe feasibility is given by the use of an existing care system with cover letters from the patients before the treatment. Possible disturbance variables such as affinity towards technology (which could lead to a lower participation rate among participants with little affinity towards technology) are controlled for and taken into account in the evaluation. Gender and diversity are considered as covariates or moderators in the statistical models.\n\nAll data of the participants will be treated in accordance with the data security regulations (DSGVO), good scientific practice and the ethical requirements. Furthermore, all patients are informed about the project, ethics and data protection in a generally understandable way by a cover letter from their clinic before the treatment. All project staff are obliged to comply with the ethics guidelines and to maintain confidentiality. The pre- and post-data of the patients are combined by means of a personal code, which does not allow any conclusion about the participant.\n\nThe results of this study will show which digital implementation forms of therapy offers are feasible in terms of benefit and acceptance and can thus contribute to the further development of health care services and medical rehabilitation. This will create the necessary evidence base to include digital offers in the classification of therapeutic services and the therapy standards based on them and thus to establish them in routine care. Furthermore, a guideline for the future integration of these services into the health care services/rehabilitation process will be developed. Due to the standardized combination of analogue and digital therapy parts, therapy goals can be achieved more efficiently on the basis of the validated pedagogical concepts used and with the involvement of fewer human resources. This is not only relevant during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, but also with regard to the relevant shortage of qualified personnel. Furthermore, the research basis for digital measures to support social support for social participation will be created. With these findings, similar measures on other groups, for example, persons with disabilities or limitations, can be researched."],"EnrollmentCount":["2000"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Health Services Research"]},{"Rank":599,"NCTId":["NCT03028792"],"OfficialTitle":["Attention Training for Underserved Youth With Anxiety"],"OverallStatus":["Unknown status"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["This study aims to test the efficacy and feasibility of administering a computerized attention training program targeting clinical levels of anxiety in Latino youth between the ages of 8-17. 52 youth from Imperial County, a rural and predominantly Latino region, will be randomized to receive either 1) a 12-session attention modification program (AMP) or 2) an attention condition program (non-active treatment).

Prior to the study start, all pediatricians/providers will receive information about the study, symptoms of child anxiety, and the use of a short screening measure to assist in detecting child anxiety. If a provider at one of the clinics identifies a child with anxiety or a parent reports that child has symptoms consistent with anxiety (fears, worries, nervousness, unexplained somatic complaints, etc.), the provider will have the option to explain the study to the parent and give them the study brochures. Alternatively, providers, if able, can also ask parents to sign a consent to contact form, giving the research team permission to contact them directly to discuss the study.\nProviders may also chose to refer the patient to the study promotora who will assist will explaining the study to the participant, screening, and consenting the participants.\nFlyers will also be posted at Sun Valley Behavioral Medical Center, a private medical clinic that serves the medical and mental health needs of children, adolescents and adults in Imperial County. In this case, parents will be expected to call our research team for more information.\nThe co-PI on this study, Dr. Denise Chavira has an ongoing school based study being conducted with high school students in Imperial Valley. Given that this study covers a range of ages (8-17), we will also recruit from high schools. As part of the existing consent form (for protocol 14-000663), students are asked to check the box if they are interested in participating in future research studies. We will contact those students who have indicated interest in future studies to discuss the current project.\n\nIn all of these methods, the community health worker/promotora/e will contact the parent to conduct an initial screen. Thereafter the promotora and/or research coordinator will arrange an in person meeting with the parent and youth to review the consent with the parent and assent form with the youth and administer the eligibility measures. The initial eligibility assessments will not be conducted until all consent/assent forms have been signed and returned to the research team.\n\nAt the end of the eligibility visits, the PIs (Chavira and Chang) will review the questionnaires to determine final eligibility. Those who are eligible will process to the baseline visit where they will receive the AMP or ACC program as well as other measures. We have included a table of these measures as well as the assessment schedule in 10.1 section 1.0.\n\nAttention Modification Program: AMP is a modified version of the dot-probe paradigm similar to the original task used by MacLeod, Mathews, and Tata. Each trial begins with a fixation cross presented in the center of the computer screen for 500 ms. The cross is then replaced by a pair of faces presented in the center of the screen for 500 ms. The face pair disappears and a probe (i.e., the letter \"E\" or \"F\") appears immediately in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. This paradigm has been modified to facilitate an attention bias away from threatening material. In this case, the probe always replaces the neutral face. Thus, although there will be no specific instruction to direct attention away from the threatening face, on all trials, the position of the neutral face will indicate the position of the probe.\n\nAttention Control Condition: Like AMP, the attention control condition is a dot-probe task that begins with a fixation cross presented in the computer screen for 500ms, is followed by a pair of faces (one neutral, one threatening) for 500ms, and then a trial is completed when the face pair disappears and a probe (letter \"E\" or \"F\") appears in the location of one of the two faces. Participants will be instructed to decide whether the letter is an E or an F and press the corresponding mouse button. The letter probe will remain on the screen until the participant responds. Response latencies to identify the probe will be recorded from the onset of the presentation of the letter probe to the button press. A total of 288 training trials will be delivered each session. However, in this case, the probe replaces both the neutral and threat face 50% of the time.\n\nAssessment. All parents and children enrolled in the study will complete assessments at baseline, mid-treatment, post-treatment and 3 month followup. Assessments will focus on feasibility outcomes and clinical outcome measures.

Both SCD and cancer can require a number of treatments and hospitalizations, which negatively impact family relationships, peer functioning, and other life domains. In addition, both conditions and treatments can involve a range of symptoms or side effects (e.g., pain, fatigue, nausea) that interfere with daily life. In other words, patients with SCD and cancer are responsible for gradually learning to manage and live with challenges associated with their medical condition. As such, recent efforts focus on providing psychological interventions to support self-management as an adjunct to standard medical care.\n\nChildren and adolescents with SCD and cancer may have limited access to skilled psychologists or may not be able to attend frequent in-person intervention visits to acquire skills to support psychosocial functioning. A critical barrier to helping adolescents with SCD and cancer is that there are few portable interventions that provide assistance outside of the hospital environment.\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to pilot test FOCUS (Framing Opportunities and Challenges Using Stories), an innovative and portable intervention designed to improve the psychosocial functioning of adolescents with medical conditions. The intervention involves taking and captioning purposeful photographs that align with The Hero's Journey, a guiding narrative template that chronicles a hero's passage through life's adventures and challenges, culminating in individual strength and transformation (Campbell, 1968). Preliminary data evaluating components of FOCUS revealed significant improvements in mood among healthy adolescents and young adults. Data suggest that reflecting on positive and negative daily events (e.g., via a photograph) and writing about the experiences have profound positive effects on a range of outcomes (e.g., grit, gratitude, functioning). In addition, the investigators intend to share the participants' photographs, stories, and advice on a website for other adolescents with SCD or cancer. Data indicate that prosocial behavior (e.g., providing advice to peers) and social connectedness have a number of positive outcomes. The central prediction is that FOCUS will be acceptable and feasible to deliver and that pilot data will reveal improvements in participants' psychosocial health. Achieving these aims will provide the foundational data needed for federal grant applications to evaluate FOCUS with a larger pediatric sample and other patient populations, powered to identify outcomes and mechanisms of change.\n\nAim.

Exercise is commonly used as a weight loss and weight loss maintenance strategy. However, exercise-induced weight loss is often much less than expected as individuals compensate for a large portion of the energy expended through exercise, resisting maintenance of the negative energy balance needed for weight loss. Our prior research, in agreement with others, point to increases in energy intake as the primary compensatory response when exercising for weight loss; however, mechanisms promoting this behavior have yet to be fully elucidated. With obesity and diabetes prevalence continually rising, innovative research is needed to identify novel mechanisms promoting energy compensation with exercise. The long-term goal of this proposal is to reduce the incidence and improve the outcomes of obesity-related diseases by developing interventions that will attenuate compensation for the energy expended through exercise and thus improve initial weight loss and weight loss maintenance.

Upon completion, we will have a greater understanding of the mechanisms underpinning compensatory increases in energy intake when exercising. These findings will pave the way for future clinical trials testing this hypothesis in the context of a long-term exercise intervention.

Greater mortality rates with obesity have estimates of life expectancy reduced by 6-7 years with up to 300,000 deaths attributed to obesity annually in the US. Obesity treatment has therefore emerged as a prime focus of health care.\n\nIncreasing physical activity and energy expenditure is a universal recommendation for weight control, with exercise becoming the most prevalent, economical, and health-promoting treatment option for obesity.\n\nUnfortunately, weight loss from an exercise program is often disappointing, and greater amounts of exercise may not always promote additional weight loss. An increasing body of evidence indicates individuals' concerted efforts to achieve weight loss through exercise are stymied by a coordinated set of compensatory responses working to maintain energy balance, conserving energy to ensure the energetic needs of vital organs are met. The primary compensatory response working to maintain energy homeostasis and thus opposing weight loss from an exercise-induced energy deficit is an increased drive for greater energy intake. This is often independent of hunger, as single bouts of exercise typically do not result in changes in appetite, food intake, or appetite- regulating hormones, while long-term exercise can actually improve the satiety response to a meal. The motivational aspects of eating, termed the reinforcing value of food, is a strong predictor of body weight and energy intake independent of hunger, although not previously studied as an important factor in energy compensation with exercise. Food reinforcement is developed by instigating a greater attentional processing towards food, termed attentional bias. These behavioral constructs are controlled by the central dopamine system, which mediates the rewarding aspects of reinforcing behaviors (such as eating) and is a more powerful driver of behavior than affective responses. Overeating occurs when the motivational wanting of food exceeds the capacity of inhibitory control for eating. As such, individuals with lower inhibitory control are more susceptible to the reinforcing aspects of food, and more likely to over-consume highly reinforcing, energy dense foods. With additional evidence eating and exercise behaviors share similar neuro-behavioral pathways possibly explaining why exercise can promote feeding in animal models, it would be of great interest to determine the influence exercise may have on food reinforcement, attentional bias, and inhibitory control for food cues in humans.\n\nOur long-term goal is to reduce the incidence and improve the outcomes of obesity by developing interventions to attenuate compensation for the energy expended through exercise thereby improving exercise as a weight loss and weight loss maintenance strategy. The overall objectives of the current proposal are to 1) evaluate whether an acute bout of exercise alters food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues, and 2) assess a potential sex effect in this response. Our central hypothesis is that exercise training will evoke greater food reinforcement and attentional bias for food cues while reducing inhibitory control as a mechanism to promote greater energy intake in effort to maintain energy homeostasis. Our hypothesis has been formulated based on our preliminary data demonstrating a large (~1,000 kcal per week) compensatory response to a 12-week exercise intervention that could not be explained by changes in resting energy expenditure, physical activity outside the exercise intervention, or hormonal mediators of appetite. This compensatory response was observed across two different studies using various exercise doses, indicating a remarkable consistency in this compensatory response. Previous research in animal models have demonstrated exercise facilitates eating, with evidence of shared neuro-behavioral pathways between eating and exercise reward that may explain this connection. These behavioral constructs influencing energy intake have not been considered as mechanisms for energy compensation and likely contribute to the unexplained compensatory response we have previously observed. The rationale for this project is that with greater knowledge of the mechanisms behind energy compensation, future interventions may be designed that attenuate this response to improve exercise's utility as a weight loss strategy. To achieve the overall objectives, we will pursue the following specific aim and exploratory aim in obese, sedentary individuals, the population in greatest need for effective weight loss treatment: Specific Aim: Demonstrate changes in food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues after an acute bout of exercise. Based on our preliminary data and previous literature demonstrating exercise may increase food reward, our working hypothesis is an acute bout of exercise will cause food to be more reinforcing, increase attentional bias for food cues, and decrease inhibitory control for food cues.\n\nExploratory Aim: We will explore whether sex moderates these responses. Others have demonstrated sex differences in food reinforcement, although the role sex plays in this response to exercise is unknown.\n\nAt the completion of the proposed research, the expected outcomes are to have identified novel mechanisms that contribute to energy compensation during an exercise program. These results will have a sustained impact as they will provide a strong evidence-based proof of principle for development of novel interventions that attenuate the compensatory response to exercise, improving its efficacy for weight control.\n\nSignificance Importance of the Problem to Be Addressed. Greater than 70% of US adults are either obese (BMI > 30) or overweight (BMI 25-29.9). Poor dietary habits and physical inactivity are the top causes for this epidemic. Over 90% of US adults fail to meet physical activity recommendations when assessed objectively, while over 95% fail to meet recommendations for solid fat and added sugar intake [5]. The impact of obesity on society is realized in its associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, gallstones, osteoarthritis, sleep apnea, premature death, and many cancers such as breast, liver, and colon. The economic impact of obesity is startling, with annual health care expenditures between $92-117 billion, making obesity among the most expensive health problems in the US [8].\n\nThe continually escalating obesity epidemic suggests the majority of individuals are unable to meet their weight loss needs. Evolutionarily conserved mechanisms that defend against a negative energy balance are, in part, to blame [9]. These mechanisms include metabolic and behavioral responses to an energy deficit that function to conserve energy by either reducing energy expenditure or promoting energy intake. Metabolic adaptations reduce resting and non-resting energy expenditure to account for approximately 120 kcal/day through mechanisms related to thyroid function, skeletal muscle glucose oxidation, and sympathetic nervous system activity. Behavioral responses to an energy deficit, on the other hand, can account for far more than 120 kcal/day and include increases in energy intake and decreases in physical activity. Many agree the most impactful compensatory response working to resist an exercise-induced energy deficit is increases in energy intake, as the rate of energy intake far exceeds the rate of energy expenditure. The mechanisms underlying this compensatory response are poorly understood.\n\nExercise is the most common weight loss strategy with a prevalence rate of 65% among those attempting to decrease body weight. Indeed, most people have the capacity to increase their energy expenditure to promote negative energy balance whereas, depending on an individual's aerobic fitness, exercise intensities can be maintained for prolonged periods at 2- to 16-fold above resting rates of energy expenditure. As such, 250 to 2500 kcal can be expended during a single exercise session resulting in an acute energy deficit that can be repeated across days. This has prompted the American College of Sports Medicine to issue separate recommendations to either maintain health or support weight loss through exercise. Exercise is also one of the primary components of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and a key aspect to the classic Look AHEAD trial primarily due to the role exercise is believed to play in weight loss and weight loss maintenance. However, reductions in body weight from exercise training are often less than expected due to the compensatory responses working to maintain energy balance noted above.\n\nOur preliminary data, in agreement with others, point to increases in energy intake being the primary compensatory response to an energy deficit induced by exercise. Other purported compensatory responses include decreases in resting energy expenditure (REE), improved skeletal muscle work efficiency, and decreased habitual physical activity outside the exercise program [9]. We have twice demonstrated non-significant changes in REE, total energy expenditure, and habitual physical activity outside the exercise intervention despite a compensatory response of approximately 1,000 kcal/week. This supports the premise that increases in energy intake are largely responsible for this compensatory response to exercise, although the mechanisms behind this response remain unknown. Identifying the mechanisms for this compensatory response is the necessary first step in developing interventions that aim to attenuate the compensatory increases in energy intake that accompany an exercise program. Such interventions would vastly improve exercise as a weight control strategy.\n\nAn often-studied mechanism responsible for greater energy intake with exercise is increased hunger, assessed by hormonal mediators of appetite, lab-based food intake, and hunger/satiety scales [28-32]. In particular, elevated concentrations of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and reductions in satiety-inducing signals such as peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide one (GLP-1), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), cholecystokinin (CCK), and leptin may all be altered to promote greater energy intake when participating in exercise training. However, single bouts of exercise typically do not result in the expected compensatory increases in appetite. Conversely, greater perceptions of fullness persist 24 hours after exercise, and long-term exercise can actually improve the satiety response to a meal. Thus, other mechanisms are likely involved, necessitating novel and innovative research to better understand the mechanisms behind this compensatory response to exercise.\n\nCentral dopamine (DA) systems are essential for experiencing reward (i.e. DA hypothesis of reward), where adaptations in this system were originally proposed to explain drug addiction. Interestingly, both exercise and eating behaviors are largely driven by this central DA system as genetic polymorphisms that control DA uptake and transport have been linked to exercise and eating reward. This offers the possibility for a neuro-behavioral cross-talk between these behaviors, explaining why individuals who exercise for weight loss often have distorted portion control, seek rewards from exercising in the form of food, and derive greater pleasure from high-fat, high-sugar, energy-dense food independent of hunger. There is evidence of such direct cross-talk between eating and exercise reward in rats, where wheel running that produces a low-level dopaminergic response facilitates eating. In humans, evidence points to exercise promoting a greater wanting to eat among individuals who overcompensate (eat more energy than they expend) due to exercise potentially having a sensitizing action that enhances food reward to increase energy intake. A similar neuro- behavioral cross-talk between the reinforcing effects of different drugs is also known, specifically involving endogenous opioid and cannabinoid systems, whereas administration of one increases the reinforcing value of the other. The possibility for exercise to increase the rewarding aspects of food and thus energy intake is therefore a probable scenario, although this has not been fully evaluated in humans.\n\nThe rewarding aspects of eating are important volitional behavioral responses influencing energy intake, assessed by defining one's reinforcing value of food. Food reinforcement is a measure of how much an individual wants to engage in a particular eating behavior, as someone who finds food highly reinforcing \"wants\" food to a greater degree. Food reinforcement is a more robust predictor of food intake than the hedonic value (i.e., liking) and is a strong predictor of body weight. Food deprivation resulting in energy deficits increases food reinforcement, and thus possible that an exercise-induced energy deficit will increase food reinforcement as a mechanism to promote feeding behavior and maintain energy balance. No study has been conducted characterizing and testing this behavioral response to exercise in humans.\n\nIncreasing the reinforcing value of a behavior is accomplished through \"incentive sensitization\". Incentive sensitization is a behavioral process where repeated exposures increase the salience of a stimulus within the environment to produce an attentional bias. This produces neuroadaptations that increase the motivating or reinforcing value of the behavior. Attentional bias towards food cues is therefore an additionally relevant and important construct to consider when elucidating the motivational implications of eating. Increased attentional bias for food cues predicts the tendency to overeat and weight status, with obese individuals having greater attentional bias towards food cues, especially for energy-dense palatable foods. Overeating occurs when motivational wanting of food exceeds the capacity for inhibitory control for eating, as such, a heightened awareness/attentional bias of food or food reinforcement may lead to overeating in those with reduced inhibitory control. This puts individuals with poor inhibitory control at a greater susceptibility to food's rewarding effects, increasing energy intake and promoting weight gain. This association has not been assessed alongside exercise, and exercise-mediated increases in food reinforcement and attentional bias may follow different patterns than previously observed cross-sectional data, which has used primarily sedentary individuals. Based on our most recent preliminary data demonstrating 38/44 participants demonstrated some form of positive compensation after a 12-week exercise intervention, exercise may either lower inhibitory control as an additional mechanism to promote energy intake, or food reinforcement and attentional bias for food cues may be increased greater than what can be mitigated by one's inhibitory control.\n\nSignificance of the Proposed Research Contribution The expected contribution is an enhanced understanding of the mechanisms underpinning energy compensation to exercise. This contribution will be significant as this will provide the necessary information to develop future trials and treatments to facilitate more successful and sustained weight loss over time from an exercise program, reducing rates of obesity and related complications. These results are intended to both improve scientific knowledge and directly inform clinical practice as it pertains to obesity treatment and prevention. Currently, behavioral compensatory responses are not commonly considered a modifiable barrier to exercise-induced weight loss, possibly due to the unknown nature of the mechanisms behind them or how they may be modified. Novel mechanisms must be identified as it appears research on traditional mediators of energy intake (hunger/satiety) do not provide a definitive conclusion. Identifying the role food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues play in the exercise-induced increases in energy intake will lead to future research targeting these mechanisms to improve the effectiveness of exercise for weight control.\n\nInnovation The status quo, as it pertains to obesity treatment, is ineffective with the continually escalating obesity epidemic serving as evidence. Exercise programs for obesity treatment often do not consider energy compensation as an integral aspect of weight loss. Our preliminary data and others have confirmed the compensatory response to exercise and that greater energy intake is the largest source of compensation. However, little is known of the mechanisms that mediate this compensatory response.\n\nThe proposed research is innovative because it challenges current obesity research paradigms by focusing on the underlying mechanisms of energy compensation with exercise. Specifically, food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues are volitional behavioral responses that will be evaluated as important mediators in the compensatory response to exercise. These constructs are strong predictors of weight status and energy intake but have yet to be evaluated in the context of exercise. With evidence that exercise can influence the neuro-behavioral processes underlying food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues, the present investigation's hypotheses are not only highly novel but also highly probable. The investigative team of Dr. Kyle Flack (PI, an experienced nutritionist, exercise and behavioral physiologist) coupled with Dr. Craig R. Rush (Co-I, an experienced behavioral scientist with expertise in attentional bias and inhibitory control) is an additionally novel aspect and uniquely suited to carry out this proposal. Successful completion will open new horizons for obesity treatment, including novel interventions that focus on attenuating exercise-induced alterations in food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues.\n\nApproach Preliminary Data. Our preliminary studies on energy compensation with exercise have indicated non-significant changes in resting energy expenditure (kcal/24 hrs) and non-exercise physical activity despite an approximate 1,000 kcal per week compensatory response regardless of exercise energy expenditure (1500 vs. 3000 kcal/week) or exercise frequency (2 vs 6 sessions/week). This demonstrates the overall magnitude of energy compensation sedentary individuals exhibit when engaging in a 12-week exercise intervention that did not include dietary restriction. Importantly, the lack of pre-post changes in REE and non-exercise physical activity indicate changes in energy intake are the primarily responsible for this 1,000 kcal/week compensatory response. Additionally, changes in the hormonal mediators of appetite and satiety were not related to this compensatory response. For this reason, research focused on identifying novel mechanisms promoting increases in energy intake when exercising for weight loss is needed to develop interventions that work to mitigate this response and thus improve weight loss outcomes. The reinforcing value of food, attentional bias, and inhibitory control for food cues are behavioral constructs known to play a large role in eating behaviors and weight status. As we have noted, there is strong rational for investigating how these behavioral constructs are uniquely influenced by exercise, centered on the shared neuro-behavioral pathways within the DA reward system that may link exercise and eating behavior. This has been observed in rodents, where exercise that causes a dopaminergic response promotes eating, but has yet to be fully investigated in humans.\n\nResearch Design. This pilot study will use a counterbalanced cross-over design to assess the acute effects of a single bout of exercise and a single bout of sedentary activity on food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues among overweight to obese, sedentary adults (n=60, 30 males, 30 females). Differences in food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues will be determined between conditions (bout of exercise vs bout of sedentary activity), time (before exercise vs. after) and sex (male vs. female). This will allow us to determine how exercise influences the behavioral mediators of energy intake compared to both a non-exercise control condition and a pre-exercise condition.\n\nSetting. All study activities will be conducted at the University of Kentucky (UK) Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), Laboratory of Human Behavioral Pharmacology (LHBP), and the Nutrition Assessment Laboratory (NAL), all located in Lexington Kentucky, on or surrounding the UK campus.\n\nParticipants, recruitment, and screening. Recruitment will include 72 community-dwelling overweight to obese (BMI 25-45 kg/m2) men (n=36) and women (n=36) aged 18-45 years who are not currently engaged in exercise or weight loss activities, nor have lost or gained over 5% of their current bodyweight in the previous 12 months. Eligible participants will also be (1) free of any cardiac, pulmonary, or metabolic health conditions, (2) able to safely engage in exercise, (3) not taking any medications or dietary supplements which may influence energy expenditure or intake and (4) have not been diagnosed with an eating disorder, clinical depression, or an anxiety disorder and (5) engage in less than 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week (assessed via accelerometry at baseline). Female participants must additionally be premenopausal and not pregnant or nursing. Ability to safely participate in exercise will be determined using a health history and Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q+) and reviewed by the study physician. Participants will be recruited from the greater Lexington, KY area using a combination of print and online media methods. Interested individuals will be screened for basic inclusion criteria (age, activity level, BMI) and, if deemed initially eligible, invited for a screening visit to further assess eligibility. Based on our previous 12-week exercise intervention performed at the University of Kentucky we will expect an overall retention rate of 85%, leaving an n=60 completing both assessment visits.\n\nProcedures Visit 1 (week 1). The Study Coordinator will meet with each participant for a 30-minute orientation session. At this time, participants will have the study explained, questions answered, complete the necessary screening questionnaires (health history, PAR-Q+), complete an Accu-Check blood glucose test, and, if deemed eligible and interested, sign the informed consent. Upon enrollment, participants will also complete a food frequency questionnaire (DHQ-3), be assessed for body composition (BodPod), and have waist circumference measured. Participants will also be provided an ActiGraph accelerometer to objectively assess physical activity for the next seven days and scheduled for Visit 2 at least eight days later. Participants will be instructed not to purposely change dietary behaviors while enrolled in the study (i.e. start to diet).\n\nVisits 2 and 3 (week 2 and 3). On the day of Visit 2, participants will record the specific foods, quantities, and time of day they consumed them prior to their testing visit. Participants will be instructed to eat the same foods at the same time of day prior to Visit 3 as they did prior to Visit 2. Visit 2 and 3 will be scheduled at the same time of day on the same day of the week where participants will be able to practice \"usual\" dietary behaviors, i.e. not on a holiday or a special occasion. Upon arriving to the LHBP exactly four hours post-prandial in the afternoon, participants will complete assessments for food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues before and twice after an acute bout of either exercise or sedentary activity, with one visit featuring exercise and the other visit featuring a sedentary activity. The order of the visits will be counterbalanced. Visual analog scales (VAS) will be performed for hunger and exercise enjoyment prior to each set of assessments. For female participants, these visits will occur while in the follicular phase, which will be assessed by a mensural cycle questionnaire. Participants will wear the accelerometer to record physical activity during the washout period between assessment visits and be instructed to remain sedentary.\n\nAcute Bout of Exercise. Participants will complete assessments of food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control before and after an acute bout of exercise during Visit 2 or visit 3 (depending on counterbalanced order). Participants will be provided a Polar A-300 heart rate monitor with smart-cal™ technology that factors the individual's sex, age, weight, activity level, and heart rate to produce an estimate of total energy in kilocalories (kcal) expended during the exercise session, with kcal expended displayed in real- time. Participants will engage in exercise on an elliptical ergometer (Octane Fitness ZR8) for the amount of time it takes them to expend 500 kcal under supervision of a researcher in the laboratory. Participants will exercise at a self-selected intensity of at least 65% heart rate reserve (HRR), an intensity commonly prescribed for sedentary individuals beginning an exercise program. Based on previous studies conducted in our lab, 500 kcal of energy expenditure is attainable for even the most sedentary individual with exercise sessions lasting between 30 and 70 minutes depending on body mass and intensity of exercise. Prescribing the exercise bout on energy expenditure rather than duration or intensity will standardize the amount of total work being done across all participants. While both the intensity and duration of the exercise could be controlled, due to differences in body mass of the participants, either the exercise time or total work would still vary. An energy expenditure of 500 kcal is specifically used to ensure the exercise bout is of sufficient volume (intensity * time) to produce weight loss if included in a long-term program and to elicit a dopaminergic response. Participants will be permitted to drink 0.5 l of water during and after the exercise bout. Participants will take a brief 15-minute rest after completing the exercise session before repeating assessments for food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control for food cues (post exercise assessment 1). Participants will repeat these assessments 60 minutes after cession of the exercise and sedentary activity bout (post exercise assessment 2).\n\nAcute Bout of Sedentary Activity. Participants will complete assessments of food reinforcement, attentional bias and inhibitory control before and after an acute bout of sedentary activity (TV). Participants will watch TV for 60 minutes, choosing from a variety of television sitcoms (DVD) void of commercial advertisements that may feature food. Participants will have access to 0.5 l of drinking water during and after the test bout of TV viewing.\n\nStatistical Analysis Linear mixed models will be fit with exercise and time as random effects to account for repeated measures and sex as a fixed effect. Response variables will be transformed if appropriate. With binary explanatory variables, an unstructured covariance matrix for the random effects will be assumed, but alternatives will be considered if needed. VAS scale ratings of hunger/satiety and exercise enjoyment will be assessed and included for adjustment as necessary. Power analysis: Because of our three response variables, we will use a Bonferroni corrected type I error rate of 0.05/3 = 0.017 for our regression models. In a linear regression model with n = 60, 30 males and 30 females, counterbalanced to start with and without exercise and then crossing over to the other treatment, we will have 80% power to detect models with R squared of 20.4% or more (nQuery 8.5.1). Our mixed models will improve model fit and decrease variance estimates compared with linear regression, thus increasing power or decreasing R squared type measures that can be detected.\n\nExploratory Aim: By including sex as a fixed effect in our linear mixed model approach, our study is designed and powered to determine the role of sex may play in the hypothesized exercise-induced changes to the behavioral mediators of energy intake assessed. Previous work in animals have identified a sex effect in eating reward/reinforcement where females have greater neurobehavioral drive to consume food. It is unknown, however, if sex may play a role in the response to exercise, warranting this exploration."],"EnrollmentCount":["32"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":614,"NCTId":["NCT01686581"],"OfficialTitle":["A 24-month, Prospective, Non-interventional Study to Describe the Long Term, Real-Life Use of BOTOX® for the Symptomatic Treatment of Adults With Chronic Migraine, Measuring Healthcare Resource Utilization, and Patient Reported Outcomes Observed in Practice"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["This is an observational study to describe the long term use of Onabotulinumtoxin A (BOTOX®) as prescribed by the physician for headache prophylaxis in adults with chronic migraine.

The protein encoded by SELENON, selenoprotein-1, functions as an endogeneous antioxidant and executes a role in cellular redox metabolism. The first results of an intervention study using KH176, currently under development for mitochondrial disease, in an animal model (Sepn1 knock out zebrafish) showed improved muscular function. Patients with mutations in LAMA2 gene causing merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) have a similar phenotype as those with mutations in SELENON gene. Key characteristics include congenital hypotonia, delayed motor development and contractures. For them no treatment is available either. Since not much is known about the clinical progression of these two congenital muscle diseases, there is an urgent need for natural history-outcome measure studies to reach trial-readiness enabling smooth transition towards clinical trials.\n\nObjective: The primary objective is to identify and follow (i.e. describe the natural history of) patients with congenital myopathy/muscular dystrophy due to mutations in SELENON- or LAMA2 genes. The secondary objectives are: 1. to select appropriate outcome measures based on the natural history data. 2. to determine the necessity for routine cardiological and respiratory screening.\n\nStudy design: This is an observational study. A standard medical history, neurological examination, functional measures, questionnaires, cardiac examination, respiratory function tests, radiological examination (qualitative and quantitative full body MRI, muscle ultrasound, DEXA scan, X-ray of the spine) and accelerometry will be performed. For each participant, the investigators will perform four six-monthly measurements over an one-and-a-half year period.

This includes surgical techniques as the widespread implementation of total mesorectal excision as well as preoperative radiochemotherapy (RCTX). The results of the recent randomized trials led to a current standard in which most (radio-) oncologists now use continuous-infusion 5-FU concomitantly with preoperative radiotherapy. It has been demonstrated that this provides improved tumor downstaging and local control; however, no significant differences have yet been achieved in the 5-year disease-free and overall survival rates.\n\nThus, the challenge is to integrate more effective systemic therapy into the combined-modality programs. The combination of RCTX with novel chemotherapeutic agents like oxaliplatin and irinotecan in phase I/II trials suggested higher rates of histopathological complete remission (pCR) compared with 5-FU RCTX alone. However, due to the lack of results from randomized trials, to date no improvement of the long-term outcomes could be demonstrated, moreover, for some studies the increased pCR rate was associated with an increase in toxicity.\n\nAnother strategy to improve outcome is to incorporate newer, biologically active, targeted therapies into established RCTX regimens. Because of its key role in signalling proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and angiogenesis the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a promising target of antitumor treatment. To date a few clinical phase I/II studies of preoperative RCTX have been initiated to evaluate EGFR inhibitors as radiosensitizer in rectal cancer. These trials demonstrated that a combination of cetuximab and RCTX could be safely applied without dose compromises of the respective treatment components. However, the pCR rates could not be improved in these studies.\n\nGiven the strong preclinical rationale to combine EGFR inhibition with RCTX in rectal cancer patients, this study aims to investigate the combination of panitumumab and a 5-FU-based RCTX in patients with locally advanced KRAS wild-type rectal cancer."],"EnrollmentCount":["48"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":626,"NCTId":["NCT04912323"],"OfficialTitle":["The R3 Vascular Drug-Eluting Bioresorbable Scaffold in Below the Knee Vessels Trial (RESOLV I)"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["This first-in-human clinical feasibility study will evaluate the safety and performance of the R3 Vascular MAGNITUDE® Bioresorbable Drug-Eluting Scaffold and Delivery System in patients undergoing treatment for peripheral arterial disease severe enough to have significantly reduced the blood supply to their leg.

The scaffold is a type of vascular stent placed within the diseased artery below the knee to improve blood flow.

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is considered the most advanced stage of PAD, occurring in about 10% of PAD patients. CLI patients typically present with ischemic rest pain, nonhealing ulcerations, infection, and/or gangrene. It is associated with a high risk of major amputation (lower limb amputations in 10% - 40% of patients at 6 months), cardiovascular events, and death (mortality rate of 20% within 6 months after the diagnosis and 50% at 5 years). A large percentage of CLI patients have occlusive disease in the infrapopliteal artery, especially in diabetics where PAD is 3 - 4 times more common. CLI related to diabetes is often more extensive, with multiple long segmental occlusions resulting in a 5 - 30-fold increase in the rate of amputations. Surgical and catheter-based revascularization procedures are typically performed to restore distal perfusion and prevent amputation in symptomatic patients.\n\nSurgical bypass has been shown to be an effective treatment when anatomic and patient risk factors permit this approach. However, patients with CLI are often poor surgical candidates because of the absence of suitable graft vessels or the presence of significant medical comorbidities. During the past decade, therapies such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and percutaneous treatment with balloons or the off-label use of coronary stents that deliver antiproliferative drugs directly to the vessel wall to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia have been on the rise and have decreased the rates of open bypass surgery.\n\nPercutaneous transluminal angioplasty has become the first line revascularization therapy for patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease. Published literature indicates that while uncoated balloon angioplasty has a high rate of technical success in obtaining a patent lumen, restenosis requiring repeat revascularization or amputation is common. For femoropopliteal (above the knee) disease, percutaneous treatment with a balloon that delivers an antiproliferative agent (usually paclitaxel) directly to the vessel wall inhibits neointimal hyperplasia and significantly reduces the rate of target lesion revascularization and restenosis, while maintaining a safety profile comparable to that of uncoated balloons. On the other hand, drug-coated balloon (DCB) therapy in the infrapopliteal (below the knee) arteries has not shown similarly convincing evidence of superiority over PTA, and in general, the use of DCB below the knee remains controversial.\n\nMetallic drug-eluting stents have been shown to effective in reducing both abrupt vessel closure and restenosis rates in the management of peripheral vascular disease. However, metallic implants also negatively impact the vessel wall by permanently preventing vasomotion, autoregulation, and adaptive remodeling. In addition, there is a risk of late vessel failure due to incomplete endothelialization of the implant, stent fracture, or malapposition. Metallic implants may also cause artifacts with noninvasive imaging and complicate future revascularization procedures. Bioresorbable scaffolds provide similar mechanical properties to metallic stents during the blood vessel remodeling phase following angioplasty, while also delivering an antiproliferative drug to the site of vascular injury to minimize neointimal hyperplasia. However, once these tasks are complete, the scaffold begins a reabsorption process and eventually disappears entirely from the vessel, leaving the native artery free of any implant. For these reasons, bioresorbable scaffolds may offer a new standard for restorative therapy in the peripheral vasculature.\n\nThis first-in-human clinical feasibility study of the R3 Vascular MAGNITUDE® scaffold will evaluate the safety and performance of a bioresorbable scaffold with a thin strut design (98 µm wall thickness) and a coating of the antiproliferative drug Sirolimus for treating patients with lifestyle limiting claudication or chronic limb threatening ischemia. The objective is to perform an initial evaluation of the investigational device in a patient population undergoing percutaneous transluminal intervention with stenting for the treatment of infrapopliteal artery lesions.\n\nThe thin strut design of the MAGNITUDE® scaffold offers improved deliverability and the potential for higher vessel patency rates compared to other thicker strut bioresorbable scaffolds currently under investigation for this particular indication. In addition, compared with metallic stents, the R3 Vascular bioresorbable scaffold provides sustained support to the vessel wall following revascularization while vascular healing occurs, after which the scaffold predictably degrades leaving no permanent implant behind. The MAGNITUDE® scaffold has been shown to be biocompatible, maintain mechanical integrity over time, and provide controlled drug release through extensive validations in pre-clinical testing and clinical studies enrolling approximately 200 patients being treated for coronary artery disease.\n\nThe RESOLV I clinical investigation is a prospective, single-arm, multi-center first-in-human feasibility study of the R3 Vascular MAGNITUDE® Bioresorbable Drug-Eluting Scaffold and Delivery System for treating vascular disease in the infrapopliteal arteries. It will enroll a maximum of 30 patients from up to 9 investigational centers in Italy, Austria, and Canada. Eligible patients who are at least 18 years of age with lifestyle limiting claudication or chronic limb threatening ischemia (Rutherford-Becker categories 3 - 5) that elect to undergo revascularization with stenting of up to three different de novo or restenotic infrapopliteal artery lesions will be treated with the investigational device and followed for five years post-implantation.\n\nSafety of the investigational scaffold will be assessed at 6 months as the composite rate of Major Adverse Limb Events (above ankle amputation in the index limb or major re-intervention) and peri-operative (30-day) mortality. Performance of the device will be evaluated as the primary patency rate of the treated vessels at 6 months, assessed by angiography. Multiple other angiographic, duplex ultrasound, and clinical assessments will be performed during the 5-year follow-up period.\n\nIt is expected that the subjects enrolled in this study will experience the same benefits as patients treated with the currently available coronary (used off label in the peripheral arteries) drug-eluting metallic stents. Treatment with the investigational scaffold may provide physicians with a promising alternative to permanent stenting, which has been shown to interfere with future treatments such as PTA or surgery. Additionally, since the investigational scaffold is designed to provide mechanical support to the target lesion for the required healing period post-treatment and disappear once healing is complete, this may allow for positive remodeling of the artery and reduce the risk of late complications (i.e., endothelial cell proliferation, restenosis, thrombosis, etc.)."],"EnrollmentCount":["30"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["Yes"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":627,"NCTId":["NCT03584711"],"OfficialTitle":["A Phase II Study Evaluating FOLFOX + Panitumumab According to a \"Stop and go\" Strategy With a Reintroduction Loop After Progression on Fluoropyrimidine as Maintenance Treatment, as the First Line in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Without a RAS Mutation"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["Single-arm, multi-centre phase II study The primary objective is to evaluate the time to failure of the strategy."],"CollaboratorName":["Amgen"],"StartDate":["April 26, 2018"],"CompletionDate":["November 2024"],"DetailedDescription":["The purpose of the OPTIPRIME phase II non-randomised study is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the combination of FOLFOX plus panitumumab according to a \"stop and go\" strategy.

The combination of SA and QG might be more beneficial to older people than either individual activity on its own, given that they are addressing different areas of functioning.

This is to help the older person achieve mental and physical relaxation by using gross motor movement. When the interventions are combined by utilising Qigong ahead of the art activities (thus, including both fine and gross motor movements) older people will reach a state of mental and physical relaxation, and moreover, will be able to express their feelings more simply in the social art activities."],"CollaboratorName":["Universitas Tarumanagara"],"StartDate":["January 2017"],"CompletionDate":["December 2017"],"DetailedDescription":["Depression is one of the most common mental disorders with regards to older people. It is a serious disease affecting an individual's entire life-situation, which can lead to suffering and a reduced level of activity in everyday life. Depression inhibits thinking capacity in self-expression and reduces the ability to communicate. Furthermore, older people with depression often use a considerable amount of energy attempting to avoid distressing emotions and negative thinking, which is one of the principal symptoms of depression.\n\nResearch findings describing the use of relaxation or meditation to prepare clients prior to the art activities are effective treatment methods in the reduction of depression and anxiety. However, adding Qigong as an initial therapy prior to the art activities enhances the effectiveness of art therapy. When older people achieve deep states of mental and physical relaxation, they will be able to activate their thinking capacity regarding self-expression by means of the use of art media. Thus, their negative feelings will be directed toward art activities, which in turn will reduce the depressive feelings.\n\nThis study is conducted as a randomised controlled trial with four groups. The four groups will be (1) Qigong exercise and art activity group as an integrated intervention (2) An art activity group; (3) A Qigong group; and (4) no intervention/daily activities. The investigators begins by allocating participants at random to one of the intervention groups. The process of randomising the participants will be collected by sealed-envelopes used in the selection process. The participants will assemble in one room and each participant will receive a sealed-envelope, which contains a card labelled with information regarding the intervention that will follow. The information will comprise the number of sessions, time period and checklist column that must be marked by the participants, in order to indicate that they are willing to follow the intervention. Once the participants know the intervention group that they are assigned to, the investigators will conduct an initial interview to obtain demographic information and to acquire data about the reason they decided to live in a nursing home. Finally, informed consent will be obtained from the participants during the initial interview. The intervention will be conducted in 8 weeks and consists of 16 sessions that will be given twice a week; each session will be last for 90 minutes.\n\nFurthermore, the investigators will evaluate participants who meet the criteria before the intervention. The measurement of the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be assessed by using MMSE and the MINI Neuropsychiatric Interview. Social demographic characteristics are included to collect data about age, sex and ethnicity, education, marital status (married or never married), family group, perceived economic status (upper, middle or lower), financial resources, medical history, lifestyle/exercise habits and information relating to admission to the nursing home. The MMSE is a brief indicator of cognitive ability of the elderly, and the MINI will be used as a screening tool to measure severe psychiatric disorders. The measurements will be given before and after the intervention using WHOQOL-BREF; SWLS, BDI-II and GDS 15-item, MMSE and SF-36.\n\nThe intervention process of the social art activities will be provided and participants will use art materials, for instance, drawing paper, pencils and coloured pencils, magazine, objects, glue, scissors/box cutters, collage and additional material. The materials are selected based on the consideration that they are not too messy or too complicated to work with. The Qigong consists of nine simple and slow movements that are suitable for older people. The integrated intervention will be presented in one session; hence, Qigong will be provided as the initial therapeutic activity preceding the art activities. The healing mechanisms to depressed older people using the art activities and Qigong can be obtained during the \"therapeutic process\", which consists of sensory stimulation, self-exploration, self-expression, communication, understanding and explanation, symbolic thinking and creativity.\n\nDuring the intervention, participants will be observed based on the observation form, to know if there is any improvement in social interaction, communication and involvement in the activities, in addition to their expression and impression during the activities. A follow-up measurement will take place 3 and 6 months after the intervention, including a follow-up interview to obtain descriptive data concerning the older person's well-being, following participation in the intervention.\n\nThe control condition consists of groups of older people engaged in regular, daily activities, for instance, watching television or just sitting and reading. The participants do activities on a regular basis in nursing homes and they are not receiving any therapeutic interventions, as above. Therefore, the investigators may consider these groups as the no-treatment groups.

Overweight and obesity are rising dramatically worldwide. In fertile women, the prevalence of obesity is one third in the United States, 20% in the United Kingdom, and 12-13% in Denmark. The association between obesity in pregnancy and the risk of gestational complications increases with increasing BMI. Among other complications, obesity in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of caesarean delivery. Delivery by caesarean section further adds significant risks of wound infection or other infectious morbidity in obese women as compared to normal weight women. The longer the woman is pregnant, the longer the risk of pregnancy complications remains. In an otherwise low-risk pregnant woman at term, it is an on-going clinical dilemma, whether the benefits of elective induction of labor (eIOL) and termination of the pregnancy will outweigh the potential harms from the concomitant induction and delivery process. Regarding delivery complications, based on data from historical cohorts, eIOL has traditionally been associated with an increased risk of caesarean section and instrumental delivery. Therefore, expectant management has been the preferred clinical option. This interpretation has now been challenged by a randomized trial (ARRIVE) with >6000 low-risk pregnant women where eIOL at 39 weeks of gestation was associated with lower caesarean delivery rates. There are no randomized studies in obese women, but two larger observational studies did find lower odds of caesarean delivery in obese women with eIOL as compared to awaiting labor onset. Hence, a randomized trial that would compare caesarean delivery among obese women whose labor is induced with those expectantly managed is warranted. The proposed study will provide new and important knowledge into the area of induction of labor among overweight and obese women with potential great international impact for the future raising number of pregnant women in this subgroup.\n\nWith this trial, the investigators aim to compare the risk of caesarean section in obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), but otherwise low-risk women with eIOL as compared to expectant management.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1 in the two following arms:\n\nIntervention arm/elective induction of labor in pregnancy at 39 gestational week and 0 to 3 days: Induction is performed according to local policy for induction of labor.\n\nComparison arm/expectant management: Waiting for spontaneous onset of labor unless a situation develops necessitating either induction of labor or caesarean section.\n\n1900 low-risk pregnant women with a pre- or early pregnancy BMI ≥ 30 carrying a singleton pregnancy will be recruited from the Danish delivery wards. In each trial site, a physician investigator will be responsible for the enrolment, the electronically randomization, and data collection.\n\nThe primary endpoint is the caesarean section rate. Among others there will be secondary endpoints on instrumental delivery, onset of labor, methods of induction, perinatal and postpartum complications both maternal and neonatal along with data on women's experience on birth measured by a questionnaire survey four to six weeks post-partum.\n\nEthics The study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the latest version of the 'Declaration of Helsinki' and the 'Guideline for Good Clinical Practice' related to experiments on humans. The Central Denmark Region Committee on Biomedical Research Ethics, and The Danish Health Authorities have approved the study.\n\nPerspectives In perspective, more than 39% of the world's population is overweight and 13% are obese by the WHO classification. Pregnant overweight women are at increased risk of pregnancy and delivery complications, and there is a need to improve maternity care for this subgroup of women. The results of this trial have the potential to generate important knowledge for the improvement of delivery in obese women and they will add key information to an on-going discussion of the effects of labor induction before term.

Soon after the introduction of coronary bypass surgery, many doctors enthusiastically adopted this approach in treating patients with unstable angina.\n\nIn 1972, emphasizing that there was no definitive evidence showing the superiority of intensive medical management or coronary bypass surgery in determining mortality and morbidity in patients hospitalized with unstable angina, some of the participating groups in the NHLBI Myocardial Infarction Research Units developed a cooperative clinical trial to compare these medical and surgical approaches to therapy.\n\nFrom 1972 through 1976, 288 patients were entered into this randomized clinical trial. One hundred forty-seven patients received intensive pharmacological medical therapy, and 141 comparable patients underwent coronary artery bypass surgery. Careful follow-up studies were performed on patients in both groups, in-hospital and during the post-hospital phase. These studies included, apart from routine physical examinations, resting electrocardiograms, chest x-ray films, and grade exercise tolerance tests at six months and twelve months.\n\nDESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\nRandomized, non-blind, sequential design with a control group and an experimental group.

There is no second-line therapeutic standard; chemotherapy (mainly, 5-FU-based combination) yields limited median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of abouty 2-3 months and 6-7 months respectively, justifying the exploration of new therapeutic options.\n\nImmune therapies (mainly, immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICI]) have opened new opportunities in cancer therapy. Hence, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) have demonstrated robust clinical activity and obtained FDA approval in several cancers.

The effects of ICI in combination with second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced BTC have not been explored to date.\n\nPlatinum salts can induce \"immunogenic cell death\". Therefore, previous treatment with platinum may increase tumor immunogenicity and sensitivity to immune therapy, particularly, ICI. The second-line setting after failure of platinum-based chemotherapy may then be an optimal biological context for testing immune therapy in advanced BTC.\n\nDurvalumab is a human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa (IgG1κ) anti-PD-L1 mAb.

Each year, the number of deaths due to prostate cancer is almost as high as the number of new cases diagnosed reflecting the poor prognosis associated with this disease. PC is insidious and is often diagnosed late. Despite advances in the management of other more common gastrointestinal cancers, the treatment of PC has had few benefits inherent in recent advances in digestive oncology. Gemcitabine has thus remained the reference treatment for more than 10 years.\n\nRecent studies have shown that gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel combination therapy is more effective in PC than gemcitabine-based therapy alone. In addition, multidrug therapy approaches (Irinotecan-5FU/LV) have also emerged to avoid the emergence of resistance to treatments while limiting toxicities. The recently developed Nal-IRI has also shown interesting efficacy in patients with metastatic PC previously treated with gemcitabine, with improved overall survival median and limited toxicity. Based on this information, the NAPOLI trial was conducted in patients with second line PC comparing the efficacy of Nal-IRI/5FU/LV or Nal-IRI and 5FU/LV alone; in this key study, the combination Nal-IRI/5FU/LV treatment was more effective than monotherapies (Nal-IRI or 5FU/LV alone).\n\nBased on all these data, a Phase II trial testing the standard of care gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel vs Nal-IRI/5FU/LV vs Nal-IRI/5FU/LV 2-months sequential regimen followed by gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel will be performed. This will allow us to i) know the tolerance and efficacy of Nal-IRI/5FU/LV in the first line of treatment, ii) test a new sequential strategy with Nal-IRI but also iii) compare our results in the experimental arms with one of the two world standard therapeutic regimens: gemcitabine + nab-Paclitaxel. All this in order to improve the management of patients with PC from the first line of treatment."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["November 16, 2018"],"CompletionDate":["December 2024"],"DetailedDescription":["Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the seventh cause from cancer and the fifth cause from cancer-related death in Europe. Nearly as many deaths occur from PC than the number of new cases diagnosed each year, reflecting the poor prognosis typically associated with this disease. PC is insidious in onset and is often diagnosed late at the stage of metastatic spread. In spite of advances made in the management of other more common gastrointestinal cancers, the treatment of PC did take only a small advantage of recent progresses in gastrointestinal oncology and targeted therapies did not significantly modify its prognosis to date.\n\nThus, for more than 10 years, gemcitabine has been the standard of care to treat metastatic PC. Recently, two positive phase III trials in metastatic PC were reported.\n\nFirst, the gemcitabine with nab-paclitaxel combination therapy was compared to gemcitabine alone in 861 randomized patients with metastatic PC. Results showed a significant improvement in response rate (RR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Second, the results of the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 trial testing the FOLFIRINOX regimen in metastatic PC patients, finally gave a hope showing a major improvement in PFS and OS as compared to gemcitabine. However, though manageable, the safety profiles of FOLFIRINOX and of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel were less favourable than that of gemcitabine. These regimens were associated with a higher incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhoea, and grade 2-3 sensory neuropathy.\n\nIrinotecan has a stronger growth-inhibiting effect than cisplatin, mitomycin C and fluorouracil on cultured pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells. In most trials testing this molecule in PC patients, however, the response rates were low (<10%) and survivals were poor. Intensive regimens with irinotecan and 5-FU have been developed in colorectal cancer patients to increase the anti-tumor effects of this combination therapy. From those, the FOLFIRI.3, in which the irinotecan is administered before and after a 5-FU 46h continuous infusion gave promising results. The investigator has tested this regimen in a phase II trial in advanced PC patients, with an objective RR of 37.5%, a median OS time of 12 months and acceptable tolerability. Considering these encouraging results the investigator has proposed a new approach to improve outcomes for patients with metastatic PC, using FOLFIRI.3 and gemcitabine alone, sequentially, to increase patient survival with a preserved quality of life (QOL). Indeed, some authors have reported that the administration of different patterns of sequential polychemotherapy was independently associated with OS in patients with PC and other gastrointestinal tumors such as metastatic colorectal cancer. Such strategies using drugs without cross-resistance sequentially may increase anti-tumor effects and limit cumulative and non-cumulative toxicities.\n\nThe investigator thus performed a randomized multicentre phase II trial to assess this sequential treatment strategy using FOLFIRI.3 and gemcitabine alternately in one arm and gemcitabine alone in the other arm, in patients with metastatic non pre-treated pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In this study the FIRGEM strategy seems to be an effective first line treatment option in good condition patients with metastatic PC. The primary endpoint was reached with a rate of PFS at 6 months of 44.9% in the FIRGEM arm while gemcitabine alone failed (25.7%). This good PFS rate at 6 months was maintained at 12 and 18 months (26.2% and 18% respectively) though median PFS was 5.0 months. Moreover, an impressive objective response rate was observed in the FIRGEM arm (40%) as compared to the gemcitabine arm (11.4%). These results confirm those of the initial phase II trial evaluating the FOLFIRI.3 regimen (37.5% objective response rate)(15) in PC patients and compare favourably with the 31.6% and 23% reported in the two trials evaluating FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel, respectively.\n\nMedian overall survival was 11 months with FIRGEM versus 8.2 months with gemcitabine (HR:0.710 95% CI: 0.457-1.103). Here again the experimental arm gave good results, with median OS in the range of those reported with FOLFIRINOX (11.1 months). The safety profile of the FIRGEM strategy showed that hematological and GI toxicities were more important than with gemcitabine alone. Interestingly no limiting sensory neuropathy was observed with our treatment schedule and a significant increase in the time to definitive deterioration of the QoL was observed in the FIRGEM group as compared with the gemcitabine group. This effect was observed for all domains.\n\nConsidering that nab-paclitaxel improves significantly patients outcome in metastatic PC when combined to gemcitabine, the addition of this drug to the FIRGEM strategy may be of particular interest. And the PRODIGE 37 trial tested this combination in a randomized phase II trial recently closed for inclusions. This trial allowed to fight the cancer with 4 different drugs, without any cross resistance described between them, given sequentially in the first 4 months of treatment. Moreover, the \"resting period\" without nab-paclitaxel may delay significantly the occurrence of the cumulative neuropathy induced by this molecule and optimised its used with such a \"stop and go\" like strategy. Results are awaited for early 2018.\n\nMore recently a liposomal irinotecan has been developed and tested in pancreatic cancer patients, it comprises irinotecan free base encapsulated in liposome nanoparticles, which keep irinotecan into the circulation sheltered from conversion to its active metabolite (SN-38) longer and use local macrophage-mediated activation, which would increase and prolong intratumoral levels of both irinotecan and SN-38. In a phase II study of 40 patients with MPA previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy, monotherapy with nal-IRI resulted in a median overall survival of 5.2 months, and a manageable toxicity profile. The NAPOLI-1 phase III trial was then conducted, comparing three arms of chemotherapy in patients previously treated with gemcitabine-based therapy: liposomal irinotecan (MM-398 or nal-IRI) alone or combined with 5FU and folinic acid, and 5FU and folinic acid alone. Combination of nal-IRI and 5FU/LV was more effective than 5FU alone or Nal-IRI alone (median OS of 6.1 vs. 4.2 and 4.9 months respectively (HR: 0.67; p=0.012). Increased hematologic and GI toxicities were also seen in the Nal-IRI arms but were manageable. Nal-IRI plus 5FU and folinic acid extends survival in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who previously received gemcitabine-based therapy. In a setting where there is a paucity of second line treatment option, this combination is an important emerging treatment option for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.\n\nConsidering all these data, the investigator proposes to run a randomized phase II trial testing the standard continuous Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel schedule vs Nal-IRI+5FU/LV vs Nal-IRI+5FU/LV for two months followed by Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel for two months before starting again Nal-IRI. This will allow i) to generate efficacy and tolerability data on the Nal-IRI/5FU combination in the first line setting, ii) to test a new sequential strategy with Nal-IRI , in regards of the interesting results obtained in second and third line pancreatic cancer treatment, iii) to control our results in the experimental arms with one of the two first line worldwide standard regimen: Gemcitabine + Nab-paclitaxel."],"EnrollmentCount":["288"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":647,"NCTId":["NCT01357486"],"OfficialTitle":["Phase II Randomized Trial Evaluating the Administration of Sorafenib or Pravastatin or Association Sorafenib-pravastatin or Best Supportive Care for the Palliative Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patient With CHILD B Cirrhosis"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["The incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) is currently increasing in Europe and in France and about 2 / 3 of patients, are not eligible for curative treatment at the time of diagnosis.

Given the increase of proportion of patients than more of 65 years old with pancreatic cancer and given the increase of life expected, it is important to know the effectiveness and tolerance of such treatment for patient older than 65 years and 76 years.\n\nFIRGEM is an original strategic sequential treatment witch alternates, every 2 month, 4 cycles of FOLFIRI.3 and 2 cycles of 3 injections of gemcitabine.

A Phase II trial testing this treatment regimen to classical regimen of gemecitabine, showed an overall survival of 11 months in the FIRGEM regimen and an overall survival of 8,2 months in the gemcitabine regimen. The rate of progression was 45% near of progression rate with FOLFIRINOX. Tolerance is close to that FOLFIRINOX regimen but this strategic doesn't induce limiting neurotoxicities and allow to use oxaliplatin in 2de line of treatment.\n\nThe trial propose to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerance of FOLFIRINOX regimen (8 cycles) with LV5FU2 in maintenance (that could increase the FOLFIRINOX tolerable without decrease efficiency), to FIRGEM regimen and to FOLFIRINOX (12 cycles) which is the reference regimen."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["December 23, 2014"],"CompletionDate":["August 2021"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["276"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":651,"NCTId":["NCT03828227"],"OfficialTitle":["Phase III Study to Evaluate the Quality of Life in Elderly Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Receiving First-line Therapy Based on Simplified Geriatric Parameters"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 3"],"BriefSummary":["A national, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III study.

Surgical resection of localised forms of gastric cancer offers the only chance of a cure. The vast majority of patients, however, present with advanced disease from the outset (locally advanced or metastatic) or recurrent after resection of a localised form.\n\nFor metastatic or locally advanced stages of gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma, the combination of 2 chemotherapy drugs (dual therapy) as compared with monotherapy or no chemotherapy, makes it possible to improve the tumour response and patient survival. Dual therapy comprising cisplatin + fluoropyrimidine (CF protocol) is considered as one of the first-line chemotherapy treatment standards.\n\nThe addition of docetaxel to the CF regime (referred to as the DCF protocol) has made it possible to improve the tumour response rate, the time to tumour progression and overall survival in a randomised phase III trial. This improvement in treatment efficacy was achieved, however, at the expense of a significant increase in grade 3-4 toxicity, including diarrhoea , neutropenia, and neutropenia with complications. Although DCF is considered as a therapeutic standard for advanced forms of gastric cancer, its use is limited in clinical practice due to its high toxicity.\n\nOxaliplatin has shown its usefulness in treatment of oesophagogastric cancer, with an efficacy at least equal to that of cisplatin. Peripheral sensory neuropathy was less common in the 5FU-cisplatin arm. In terms of treatment efficacy, 5FU-oxaliplatin versus 5FU-cisplatin was associated with a non-significant improvement in median progression free survival rates, and overall survival.\n\nAll these data thus suggest that 5FU-oxaliplatin is at least as efficacious and is better tolerated than 5FU-cisplatin, and also that docetaxel-5FU-cisplatin is more efficacious than 5FU-cisplatin, with limited use due to its high toxicity. In the logical continuation of development of chemotherapy protocols for metastatic gastric cancer, the question therefore arises of the usefulness of adding docetaxel to 5FU-oxaliplatin, in terms of efficacy and also tolerance.\n\nIn France, chemotherapy with FOLFOX is used extensively as a first line of treatment in advanced gastric cancer, but with progression-free survival and median survival rates that are still too low, and a poor response rate. The use of docetaxel at a dose of 50 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in combination with FOLFOX (TFOX protocol) has shown very interesting results in phase II studies in terms of efficacy and tolerability, and these are worth confirming through a phase III randomised trial. In fact, if these results are confirmed in phase III, TFOX could become the new first-line therapeutic standard for advanced gastric cancer, while limiting toxicity and preserving patients' quality of life, and could become the reference treatment to accompany the targeted therapies currently being developed for this disease.\n\nThe primary objective of this randomised phase III trial is to compare the progression-free survival on dual therapy with 5FU-oxaliplatin (FOLFOX protocol) with triple therapy with 5FU-oxaliplatin-docetaxel (TFOX protocol) in treatment of advanced forms of gastric or oesophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. The secondary objectives are overall survival, the tumour response rate, toxicity, quality of life and the therapeutic index, defined as the ratio between the median progression-free survival and the febrile neutropenia rate."],"CollaboratorName":["UNICANCER","GERCOR - Multidisciplinary Oncology Cooperative Group"],"StartDate":["December 2016"],"CompletionDate":["December 2022"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["506"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":656,"NCTId":["NCT02885753"],"OfficialTitle":["Systemic Oxaliplatin or Intra-arterial Chemotherapy Combined With LV5FU2 +/- Irinotecan and an Target Therapy in First Line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Restricted to the Liver"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 3"],"BriefSummary":["Colorectal cancer is the 3rd most common cancer in France and the 2nd cause of death from cancer. Between 30 to 60% of patients develop limited or predominant liver metastases. Surgical resection of these metastases, only curative treatment is not immediately possible in 10-15% of cases. In unresectable patients, current palliative treatments are based on systemic chemotherapy associated or not with the targeted therapies (anti-EGFR (panitumumab), anti-VEGF (bevacizumab)). In this patient population, special attention was paid to intensified treatment regimens in order to improve their efficiency and improving the tumoral response rate, the intensity of the response and its earliness correlate with improved overall and progression-free survival.\n\nThe intra-arterial use of oxaliplatin coupled with IV chemotherapy has yielded OR levels of 64% in patients having survived one or more lines of chemotherapy IV and 62% in patients who have progressed on oxaliplatin IV. In addition, the HIA administration of oxaliplatin limits systemic and especially neurological toxicities, thanks to a greater hepatic clearance.\n\nIn conclusion, the combination of systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapy and HIAC with oxaliplatin has showed promising efficacy results associated with good tolerance from the first line onwards. Indeed, we can expect from the Phase II recent data, a control rate close to 100%, with high response rates associated with early maturity and depth responses as well as prolonged survival.

They are the 6th most common type of digestive cancer. Their therapeutic management is complex and must be multidisciplinary in nature.

A population study in the Côte d'Or region of France reported a survival rate at 5 years of approximately 10%.\n\nFor the locally advanced or metastatic forms, treatment has not been properly codified. With respect to chemotherapy, prospective studies, most often phase II, are difficult to interpret due to a limited number of patients and due to the heterogeneity of this type of tumour (bile duct and pancreas tumours). Treatment with 5FU alone provides an objective response in approximately 10% of cases. In combination with mitomycin or carboplatin, the objective response rate is 20%, with a median survival period of 5 months. Interferon combined with 5FU has a better response rate (30%), but occurrences of different types of toxicity are more frequent.\n\nMore recently, gemcitabine and the 5FU-cisplatin combinations demonstrated objective tumour control in 50% of patients with a median survival period of 10 months. Gemcitabine combined with oxiplatin or with cisplatin has shown the same response rate but a median survival period of approximately 12 months.\n\nThe benefit of this combination has been confirmed in a phase III trial that compared the gemcitabine-cisplatin combination to gemcitabine alone, in 410 patients with locally advanced unresectable and/or metastatic bile duct cancer.

The response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) have also been improved with these triple therapies; the response rates were 31.6% versus 9.4% p < 0.001 and the median PFS 6.4 months versus 3.3 months p < 0.001, respectively.\n\nThe adverse events observed with the triple therapy occurred more frequently, for febrile neutropaenia (5.4%), with the need to treat with growth factors (G-CSF for 42.5% of patients). Haematological and digestive toxicity was also higher: grade 3-4 neutropaenia was observed for 45.7% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 18.7% of patients in the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.0001); vomiting was noted for 14.5% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX arm and 4.7% in the gemcitabine arm (p = 0.002).

Web-based interventions have several advantages; they can include more information and treatment components than traditionally delivered treatments and they are accessible at any time and place. The five-week structured intervention is delivered using the novel web- and mobile-based program Youth Compass plus. Youth Compass plus has been developed based on the feedback for the Youth COMPASS pilot program (see ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03274934). The exercises of Youth Compass plus have been modified, visual aspects have been improved and new game-based interactive elements have been developed. In the Youth COMPASS pilot study, psychology students acted as (human) coaches for the users. While interaction with a personal coach increases commitment to the program, the need to train and supervise coaches limits large scale dissemination. To provide an alternative that is less demanding in terms of resources, we have developed a chatbot (eCoach) as a new feature within the new Youth Compass plus program.

An effective intervention to prevent IPA would therefore be welcome. The incidence of IPA in neutropenic hematology patients in our institution was recently estimated to be 5-10%. Currently, only HEPA filtration is routinely used for the prevention of IPA. In 1988, Schmitt et al. showed a significant delayed mortality in rat model of IPA when rats were treated with aerosolized conventional amphotericin-B (amB) two days before infection (1). Conventional amB may interfere with surfactant function in the lungs. In contrast, liposomal amphotericin-B contains phospholipids that are structurally related to surfactant and inhibits natural surfactant function only slightly. Furthermore, in rats, mean concentrations of AmB in lungs were 3.7 times higher at day one and almost 6 times higher at day seven after a single dose treatment with aerosolized liposomal amB when compared with conventional AmB (2). Only one non-placebo controlled randomized clinical trial evaluated the prophylactic use of inhalation therapy with conventional amB for the prevention of IPA and a non-significant 43% reduction was observed (3). We postulate that the weekly inhalation of liposomal AmB in neutropenic hematology patients can prevent IPA.\n\nIn this randomised placebo controlled clinical trial we compare the safety and efficacy of the administration of nebulized liposomal AmB (2x/week) with placebo for the prevention of IPA in haematological patients with an expected duration of neutropenia of >10d.

Other CRC, i.e. 15%, are \"microsatellite unstable\" (MSI) with deficient DNA Mismatch-Repair system (dMMR). These latter are characterised by generation of many neo-antigens, which result in a high anti-tumour immune response and a high peri- and/or intra-tumour lymphocyte infiltration (TIL). Investigators recently showed, with a prospectively validated immune score, that 14% of localised MSS/pMMR CRC are also highly infiltrated by CD3+ lymphocytes. This same immune score has made it possible to measure high lymphocyte infiltration in hepatic metastases, in particular, in patients treated with XELOX/FOLFOX.\n\nPembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (programmed death-1) is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) of PD1/PD-L1 axis, recently approved in many cancers. Anti-PD1 antibodies have recently been reported as being very effective in patients with dMMR metastatic CRC (mCRC). In the study by Le DT et al. pMMR mCRC did not seem to benefit from anti-PD1 antibodies. However, it is possible that 20% of pMMR mCRC with a high CD3+ infiltrate in the tumour may be a subgroup of pMMR mCRC sensitive to ICI, as is the case for dMMR mCRC. Lastly, immunogenic cell death induced by chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin, can increase the efficacy of ICI.\n\nThe prognostic value of lymphocyte infiltrate has been demonstrated in CRC by several teams. However, no validated test is used in routine clinical practice. Previously, investigators described an automated and reproducible method for analysis of TIL and investigators validated it for clinical use. Automated tests evaluating TIL are performed on virtual slides and have showed that, out of 1,220 tumours tested, 20% were highly infiltrated by CD3+ T cells. Patients presenting with a pMMR CRC with a high immune infiltrate had a better progression-free survival (HR=0.70; p=0.02). An immunoscore® described by Galon et al. has also a high prognostic value in CRC and is based on CD3+ and CD8+ T cells infiltration in the center and periphery of the tumour. Finally, approximately 14% of tumours with a high immune infiltrate have been found in patients with metastatic CRC.\n\nInvestigators formulated the hypothesis that patients with a pMMR CRC with a high immune infiltrate can be sensitive to ICI . Therefore, blocks of resected primary tumour will be collected and analysed prospectively. For each patient, slides containing tumour tissue and adjacent non-tumour tissue will be analysed using two techniques : immunoscore® and TuLIS score.It consist in Immunohistochemistry with CD3 and CD8 staining. Slides will be scanned and analysed by image analysis as previously described . Tumours will then be classified as having a \"high\" or \"low\" immune response according to type of lymphocyte infiltrate, which is independent of pre-analytic conditions. Only patients with a high immune response will be eligible for the POCHI trial. Other biomarkers will be analysed like other immune populations or mutational load. If investigators identify an immune score which seems clinically relevant to predict sensitivity to ICI in pMMR mCRC, this will make it possible to plan a randomised phase III trial comparing chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic antibody versus chemotherapy and anti-angiogenic antibody plus pembrolizumab in patients with a pMMR mCRC with a high immune score and/or a hypermutated genotype.\n\nInvestigators choose PFS at 10 months as primary endpoint in POCHI trial because it is a surrogate marker of OS. Actually median PFS in first-line setting with a doublet plus a biological agent is range from 8 to 11 months in unresectable mCRC, corresponding to a PFS of 50% at 10 months. The alternative clinical hypothesis to obtain 70% of patients alive and without progression at 10 months is ambitious and currently not achieved with current chemotherapies plus a biological agent. Up until now there is no data concerning survivals outcomes of patients with a MSS mCRC with high immune infiltration score."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["April 6, 2021"],"CompletionDate":["September 30, 2023"],"DetailedDescription":[],"EnrollmentCount":["55"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":678,"NCTId":["NCT03959293"],"OfficialTitle":["A Randomized Phase II Study Evaluating FOLFIRI + Durvalumab vs FOLFIRI + Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in Second-line Treatment of Patients With Advanced Gastric or Gastro-oesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma"],"OverallStatus":["Active, not recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["Gastric adenocarcinoma is the 4th most frequent cancer and the 2nd leading cause of cancer mortality.

In a trial with pembrolizumab, only PD-L1 positive tumors were eligible to the treatment with a cut off at 1%. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and 67% had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. The overall response rate was 22%. The median PFS and OS were 1.9 months and 11.4 months, respectively.

Indeed, most patients in the French multicentric first-line GASTFOX trial (506 patients planned between 2017 and 2020) can be included in the second-line setting in the DURIGAST trial.

Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma has a poor prognosis with short overall survival (ranging from 10% to 15% at 5-years) even after surgical complete resection and despite the progress in therapeutic approaches. Most of the patients have metastatic, locally advanced or recurrent unresectable disease. So, systemic treatment remains an important issue especially since chemotherapy improves survival and quality of life (compared to best supportive care alone). First-line chemotherapy depends on HER2 status, which also influenced overall survival (14 months for HER2 positive versus 10 months for HER2 negative tumors). In HER2 negative tumors standard first-line regimen is a doublet of fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) plus a platinum salt (cisplatin or oxaliplatin). 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine as also cisplatin and oxaliplatin have similar efficacy but different toxicities.\n\nIn patients whose tumor overexpresses the HER2 receptor adding trastuzumab to fluoropyrimidine/cisplatin regimen increased overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. In HER2 negative tumors the addition of docetaxel to cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine regimen increased overall survival but its use remains limited in clinical practice because of its high toxicity. Preliminary results demonstrated a high efficacy with less toxicities of docetaxel-oxaliplatin-fluoropyrimidine combination, also called TFOX/FLOT regimen. Indeed, in France a large phase III trial comparing TFOX versus FOLFOX in first-line treatment of patients with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma is ongoing (GASTFOX, trial NCT03006432). Primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) and 506 patients are planned between 2017 and 2020 (actually at the date of January 30, 2018, 65 patients are included).\n\nSecond-line chemotherapy improves overall survival (OS) as compared to best supportive care alone in patients with an acceptable general condition (performance status 0-2). Indeed, with docetaxel monotherapy there was a significant difference in overall survival for the chemotherapy arm with a median of 5.2 versus 3.6 months in best supportive care alone arm (HR=0.67, p=0.01). Weekly paclitaxel monotherapy is also used because of its good efficacy-toxicity ratio. Irinotecan monotherapy also significantly improves overall survival compared to supportive care alone in a phase III study (4.0 versus 2.4 months; HR=0.48, 95%CI 0.25-0.92; p=0.012). Recently ramucirumab monotherapy demonstrated its efficacy on overall survival in a randomized, placebo-controlled second-line metastatic study. In a randomized phase 3 trial ramucirumab also showed its efficacy in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel monotherapy with a median overall survival of 9.6 versus 7.4 months, respectively (p=0.017; HR=0.81). However, the \"amelioration du service medical rendu\" (ASMR) assessed by the French \"Haute Autorité de Santé\" (HAS) consider an insufficient benefit to a reimbursement of ramucirumab in France. The HAS gave a moderate ASMR opinion (ASMR IV).\n\nDocetaxel is more and more frequently used in first-line chemotherapy then in this setting taxane (alone or combined with others drugs) cannot be used as second-line regimen. Indeed, based on a phase III trial FOLFIRI (5-FU plus irinotecan) is one most used regimen in second-line in European countries, especially in France. FFCD 0307 trial, a phase III comparing FOLFIRI-ECX (epirubicin-cisplatin-capecitabine) to the reverse sequence (ECX-FOLFIRI), showed that both sequences are possible.\n\nHuman tumors tend to activate the immune system regulatory checkpoints as a means of escaping immunosurveillance. For instance, interaction between PD1 (Program Death 1) and PD-L1 (Program Death 1 ligand) will lead the activated T cell to a state of anergy. PD-L1 is up regulated on a wide range of cancers. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), called immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have consequently been designed to restore T cell activity. Others ICIs are investigated, notably cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors. CTLA-4 transmits an inhibitory signal to T cells to prevent early excessive T cell activation. CTLA4 blockade may stimulate a more robust antitumor response by sustaining activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes and may overcome immune suppression mediated by regulatory T cells. ICIs have been recently tested in many cancers with promising results, especially in tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) and/or PD-L1 overexpression.\n\nPreliminary results in metastatic gastric cancer with anti-PD1 mAbs are highly promising. In a trial with pembrolizumab, only PD-L1 positive tumors were eligible to the treatment with a cut off at 1%. Thirty-nine patients were enrolled and 67% had received at least two prior chemotherapy regimens. The overall response rate was 22%.

The overall response rate was between 8% to 24% and the median OS between 4.8 to 6.9 months according to treatment arm.\n\nOthers anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1/anti-CTLA4 mAbs are also currently under investigation in gastric cancer alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Nevertheless, up until now there is no published data concerning ICI plus chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Finally, immunogenic cell death induced by chemotherapy may enhance efficacy of ICIs. Durvalumab (MEDI4736) is a human monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1 in development for the treatment of many cancers. A phase I study included 16 patients with advanced gastric cancer and the objective response rate was 25%. Tremelimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against CTLA-4. Durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination showed a manageable tolerability profile, with antitumour activity irrespective of PD-L1 status in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Durvalumab alone or combined with tremelimumab is evaluated in phase III studies in NSCLC (e.g NEPTUNE and MYSTIC), small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN), hepatocellular carcinoma (HIMALAYA), bladder cancer (DANUBE) and head and neck cancer (EAGLE and KESTREL).\n\nConcerning safety of anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 combination, in the randomized phase I/II CheckMate-032 study, that included 160 patients, there was no unexpected toxicity signal. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events were 17%, 47%, and 27%, respectively. These rates of grade 3 and 4 treatment-related adverse events are those usually found with the anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 combination in other tumors, observed approximately in 40% of patients. Up until now, there is no published data concerning combination of ICIs plus irinotecan. Nevertheless, in all trial combining chemotherapy plus anti-PD1 and/or anti-CTLA4 chemotherapy drugs were used at full-dose (5FU, oxaliplatin, cisplatin…). An Italian trial just started and combined full-dose FOLFOXIRI (5-FU 3200 mg/m2 plus irinotecan 165 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2) with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg) and atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1, 840 mg) in metastatic colorectal cancers as first-line treatment. FOLFOXIRI is a triplet chemotherapy more \"toxic\" than FOLFIRI doublet chemotherapy and this trial is a randomized phase II (FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab and atezolizumab versus FOLFOXIRI plus bevacizumab). There is, however, a preliminary safety phase in 6 patients, once they have all received at least 2 cycles of treatment, the latter being administered at full dose (AtezoTRIBE trial, NCT03721653).\n\nThe present randomized multicentric non-comparative phase II study aimed to assess the rate of patients alive and without progression at 4 months with advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, pre-treated with fluoropyrimidine + platinum +/- taxane, with two arms Folfiri plus durvalumab versus Folfiri plus durvalumab plus tremelimumab. Indeed, most patients in the French multicentric first-line GASTFOX trial (506 patients planned between 2017 and 2020) can be included in the second-line setting in the DURIGAST trial. Due to the lack of data concerning Folfiri plus durvalumab plus tremelimumab combination, a safety run-in phase will be performed at the beginning of the DURIGAST trial."],"EnrollmentCount":["107"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":679,"NCTId":["NCT03186326"],"OfficialTitle":["Multicenter Randomized Phase II Study Comparing the Effectiveness and Tolerance of Avelumab Versus Standard 2nd Line Treatment Chemotherapy in Patients With Colorectal Metastatic Cancer With Microsatellite Instability (MSI)"],"OverallStatus":["Active, not recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["Immune chekpoints (ICI) are evaluated in many digestive cancers. Certain types of cancer appear to be rather refractory to ICI such as colorectal cancers (CRC). However, the MSI CRC representing approximately 15% of the CRCs exhibits a high mutational load which generates many potentially immunogenic neoantigens. In addition, strong expression of PD-L1 was found in the MSI CRCs relative to the CRC (MSS) stages. Localized MSI CRCs have a better prognosis than MSS CRCs, probably due to immunogenic neoantigens associated with a CD8 + T-specific immune response. On the oher hand, in metastatic CRC (mCRC) things are different because i) the MSI frequency is only 4 to 7% and ii) the good prognosis conferred by the MSI status is controversial.\n\nPreliminary results suggest that patients with MSI mCRC are highly sensitive to ICI even chemoresistant tumors receiving several lines of chemotherapy. Recently, another anti-PD1 alone or in combination with an anti-CTLA4 (antigen associated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte 4) was tested in the MSI CRCs and a selection of interesting results in heavily pretreated patients with a disease control rate of 56% for monotherapy and 81% for combinated therapy.\n\nAnti-PD1s now have marketing authorization for patients with melanoma and metastatic pulmonary carcinoma , Which are known to have a high level of mutations . ICIs appear to be as promising in MSI CRCs as in other tumors and therefore face the same major challenges.\n\nAvalumab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody recently tested in several different types of tumors with promising results and is currently being studied in phase III in gastric cancer. There is no data on the effectiveness of this ICI in the MSI mCRCs. In addition, only anti-PD1 was used in the MSI-mCRC and not the anti-PD-L1, and only in chemoresistance (3rd line or more).

Study Procedures:\n\nEach potential patient has to be informed about the study contents by the investigator and to sign the informed consent if he/she wants to participate to the study.\n\nThen Each patient will be assigned to a unique allocation number at the first screening visit. A single patient cannot be assigned to more than one allocation number.

If appropriate, the information can be aggregated in a line listing of SUSARs in periods and the volume of SUSARs generated. This line listing should be accompanied by a concise summary of the evolving safety profile of the investigational medicinal product.\n\nIf a significant safety issue is identified, either upon receipt of an individual case report or upon review of aggregate data, the sponsor will issue as soon as possible a communication to all investigators.\n\nA safety issue that impacts upon the course of the clinical study or development project, including suspension of the study program or safety-related amendments to study protocols should also be reported to the investigators.\n\nData Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB):\n\nThe study will be monitored by an independent external Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)/ Data Monitoring Committee (DMB). The DSMB will provide recommendations to the Oversight Committee. The Oversight Committee (consisting of the sponsor and coordinating investigator Dr. med. Hans Jaeger and principal investigator Prof. Johannes Bogner) will provide the overall scientific direction for the trial, and will receive and decide on any recommendations made by the DSMB. The Oversight Committee must approve all scientific reports concerning the main findings of the trial. The membership, procedures, functions and responsibilities of the Oversight Committee and DSMB will be identified in the New Era DSMB Charter.\n\nAnnual Safety Report (ASR):\n\nIn addition to the expedited reporting required for SUSAR, Sponsor will submit once a year throughout the clinical trial (or on request) a safety report to the competent authority (BfArM), and the relevant Ethics Committees of the concerned Member States.\n\n4. Data Analysis:\n\nThis proof-of-concept study using a small, targeted number of subjects is carried out to determine if eradication of HIV is possible. A design with a placebo was discouraged in the light of possible eradication. The chronically infected patients serve as their own controls. Prior to baseline, these patients are monitored while on persistently suppressive HAART lasting already for at least 36 months and then switched to multi-drug class HAART.\n\nBased on the assumption, that MDC (multi-drug class) HAART with Raltegravir and Maraviroc leads to a mean reduction of at least one 1 log in patients with PHI and assuming a standard deviation of 1 and a 95% confidence interval (0.5-1.5 log) with a width of 1, the sample size is calculated at ≥16 (assumption of normal distribution).\n\nIntensification of HAART with Raltegravir and Maraviroc in chronically infected HIV-patients may have similar effects (Ramratnam B, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2004; 35:33-37). Sample size calculation can be used also for chronically infected HIV-patients.\n\nA sample size of 40 patients (20 primary infected patients (Stratum I, PHI) and 20 chronically infected patients (Stratum II, CHR) was chosen. Drop-outs in the first 12 months will be replaced.\n\nIn the course of this study no gender specific differences are expected. The application of Maraviroc and Raltegravir does not differ in male and female patients. The proportion of male and female patients will probably be in accordance with the epidemiologic data in Germany.\n\nHypothesis:\n\nThe hypotheses of this study is, that with MDC HAART, a mean reduction in proviral DNA of 1 log can be achieved by 36 months.\n\nNull hypotheses H0: Mean reduction of proviral DNA < 1 log. Alternative hypotheses H1: Mean reduction of proviral DNA ≥1 log Level of significance : 0.05 Statistical test: One-tailed paired t-test\n\nThe null hypotheses will be rejected if the p-value of the test is less than the significance level (0.05).\n\nThe null hypotheses will be accepted if the p-value of the test greater than 0.05.\n\nStatistical Methods:\n\nFor accepting or rejecting the primary hypothesis (of the trial, one-tailed paired t-test will be used.\n\nPerformed analysis will be descriptive and explorative."],"EnrollmentCount":["47"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":[],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":[],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":699,"NCTId":["NCT02008669"],"OfficialTitle":["Evaluation of the Nutritional Status of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis and Relationship With Fatigue"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive neurological disease, the leading cause of disability after injury accidents in young adults.

However, living longer does not mean living healthier. So, it is urgent to promote effective interventions in elderly people's health, quality of life and independency, aiming to be able to live autonomous in their homes and in community (WHO).\n\nAging involves changes on the body and its functions, for example the praxis skills, which leads to a visible decrease on the performance of Activities of Daily Living (ADL's) (e.g. self-care and domestic activities). These difficulties are also associated to dysfunctionality and poor quality of life. All of these decreases are also associated with emotional problems, sleep disorders, and pain.\n\nIn recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in more integrative therapeutic interventions. In particular, therapeutic relaxation programs have been increasingly reported to be effective interventions for preventing the functional and emotional losses, associated to the aging process, as well as for promoting health and quality of life indicators. There is a specific method of therapeutic relaxation - Psychomotor Massage - that has been frequently applied in order to improve health and quality of life indicators of elderly people. However, to the best of the investigator's knowledge, no study has yet examined the effects of such innovative relaxation intervention method, particularly comparing them to the effects of a common therapeutic relaxation method, such as Progressive Muscle Relaxation.\n\nTherefore, this experimental randomized controlled trial aims to examine the effects of two therapeutic interventions programs based on the relaxation techniques mentioned above in health and quality of life indicators (daily activities, psychomotor abilities, cognitive functioning, emotional states, pain perception, quality of sleep, body awareness and body image) of community dwelling Portuguese elderly people.\n\nSubjects above 60 years living in the community will be invited to participate in this study and will be randomized by three groups: control, Psychomotor Massage, and Progressive Muscle Relaxation.

Furthermore, the strength of these implicit associations increases the risk of suicidal behavior in the follow-up period of six months by a factor of six. In these previous studies, the implicit \"self-death association\" (the so-called death-identity bias) was investigated. This study will additionally examine an implicit emotional evaluation (death-evaluation-bias). Therefore, two new versions of the IAT-S, which measure how death vs. life are emotionally evaluated, are being tested. In addition, a fourth version of the IAT-S was added and aims to clarify the implicit association between death / life and internal / external locus of control. Previous studies have shown that an internal locus of control is a protective factor and an external locus of control a risk factor for suicide attempts. In the present study, these four IAT-S versions are carried out with different groups of patients: patients with a suicide attempt (1), patients with suicide ideation (2) and patients with neither a suicide attempt nor suicide ideation (3).

Randomized studies from Asia, Europe and the United States all demonstrated superior disease free survival with the use of perioperative therapy1-4. While radical gastrectomy plus D2 lymphadenectomy is the standard treatment in the treatment algorithm, the regimen of perioperative therapy has not been standardized. Earlier studies conducted in Europe and the United States using perioperative Epirubicin, Cisplatin, 5-FU (ECF) or postoperative chemoradiation were criticized owing to inadequate lymph node dissection. Adjuvant chemotherapy with either combination Capacitabine and Oxaliplatin or single agent S-1 has been proven in large prospective randomized studies in Asia, and these regimens are most commonly utilized currently.\n\nPerioperative combination chemotherapeutic regimen using 5-FU, Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin and Docetaxel (FLOT) has been recently recommended in European countries. Initial phase II study demonstrated a dramatic improvement in complete tumor response rate (TRG1a) at 20% compared with 6% for ECF5. Results from a phase III randomized study showed superior overall survival using FLOT when compared with ECF (Median survival ECX/ECF 35months, FLOT 50 months, p=0.012)6. Radical surgery has been standardized in these recent studies.

The compliance rate to preoperative chemotherapy is also generally higher than postoperative therapy. Some may propose that it may also aid in selecting appropriate cases for radical surgery, thus avoiding unnecessary surgery in those who progress quickly. However, the potential drawback of such treatment regimen includes higher risk of surgery after chemotherapy and potential delay of curative surgery.\n\nThere is currently lack of prospective comparative data between adjuvant XELOX and perioperative FLOT.

The focus is on language and communication in children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20 spoken words). Remaining nonverbal past the age of 5 years has been considered a poor prognostic indicator for future language developments, yet few interventions have been developed to address this problem. The Specific Aims for this project are (1) to further investigate a multimodal intervention for school-age children with minimal verbal skills-defined as less than 20 words spontaneously spoken, signed, or selected via graphic symbol selection-and (2) to identify significant covariates associated with differential responding to the intervention. The research addresses an unmet need to promote spoken word production in children who remain essentially nonverbal well past the ages associated with speech acquisition. The project is also innovative because: a) it investigates a multimodal intervention based on principles of phonotactic probability and neighborhood density in combination with augmentative and alternative communication (AAC), and b) it investigates novel predictors of treatment response that are obtained through cutting-edge technologies. This intervention will have better success than past interventions because the intervention will provide increased input through speech, digitized speech and visual images and additional speech sound practice for words that are comprised of high frequency sounds in the child's repertoire. Extant speech sounds in each participant's repertoire will be identified using LENA™ digitized recordings. Vocabulary words will then be selected based on a child's speech sound repertoire and principles of word learning-words with high probability speech sound sequences will be selected and taught with either multimodal intervention or a treatment as usual condition. Responses to these interventions will be evaluated using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMART) design. Different outcomes may be associated with individual and environmental predictors identified in our previous research. Individual predictors include verbal comprehension, imitation skills, adaptive behavior, nonverbal speech sound repertoire, and communication complexity. Communication complexity will be measured with the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS), developed by the Principal Investigator. Environmental predictors include language input to the child as measured with LENA™ recording devices. Results will determine if the multimodal intervention is more successful than treatment as usual for teaching word productions."],"CollaboratorName":["Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)"],"StartDate":["November 1, 2016"],"CompletionDate":["May 31, 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["Communication is an essential aspect of life for all individuals including children with autism. Many children with autism are severely impaired in their verbal communication development and there is a need for additional research demonstrating the effectiveness of interventions that improve communication for participants with autism and severe communication impairments. The proposed study directly follows from a recently published pilot study demonstrating both the feasibility and importance of an intervention designed for children with autism and minimal verbal skills (less than 20 words pre-intervention) (Brady et al., 2015). The project will follow up this pilot study with a two stage SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design that will allow comparison of results from an experimental intervention to a treatment as usual condition, and compare two intensities of multimodal intervention. Further, the project will investigate how proposed variables measured at the outset of intervention predict responsiveness to the treatment conditions.\n\nAim 1. Investigate the effectiveness of a multimodal intervention aimed at teaching students with autism and minimal verbal skills to produce new words with speech and augmentative communication (AAC). Briefly, the multimodal approach combines joint book reading, computerized instruction, and AAC. The AAC component teaches participants to select target words on speech generating devices in communication routines. All components will focus on teaching a set of vocabulary selected for each participant based on results from digitized recordings of sounds produced over a 12-hour time period. Target vocabulary will be one-syllable words that consist of sounds in each child's phonetic repertoire in sequences that are highly represented in the English language (i.e., high phonotactic probability) and determine if increasing intensity leads to better outcomes for participants who do not respond to the initial intervention. Increased intensity or regular multimodal intervention may be better for those who do not respond to treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures include:\n\nTotal number of words each child learns to say and the number of words each child learns to produce with AAC during intervention.\nTotal number of words each child says in generalization contexts. Generalization of word use to classrooms and at home will be measured with recordings from generalization probes conducted in homes and classrooms.\n\nAim 2. Investigate potential predictor variables for individual differences in learning outcomes measured in Aim 1. Results from Brady et al. (2015) showed 5 of 10 participants were \"high responders\" to multi-modal intervention - learning 18 or more new words over approximately 2 months of intervention. However, three participants learned to say only a few words and two participants essentially made no progress. The project will examine individual predictors of differential responding and identify variables that will enable clinicians to personalize intervention according to specific environmental and participant characteristics. The proposed predictor variables are:\n\nEnvironmental variables: Based on previous research linking the amount and type of environmental input to children's word acquisition, vocabulary input from parents and teachers will be measured with automated speech recognition technology. Existing technology available through LENA™ software (Warren et al., 2010) will be used to measure total number of words produced by communicative partners and conversational turns in home and school environments.\nParticipant characteristics: Based on the pilot investigation as well as previous longitudinal studies, the following specific child variables are proposed to be predictive of responsiveness to one of the experimental interventions: verbal imitation, receptive vocabulary, adaptive behavior, autism severity, and nonverbal communication complexity measured with the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS; Brady et al., 2012).\n\nResults will drive the development of more effective adaptive language interventions for minimally verbal children with autism and related intellectual and developmental disabilities."],"EnrollmentCount":["60"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":734,"NCTId":["NCT04790864"],"OfficialTitle":["Speaking Out Against Anxiety: Feasibility and Efficacy of an Online Large-group One-session Treatment for Public Speaking Anxiety and the Role of Expectancy Violation"],"OverallStatus":["Completed"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Different conceptualizations of public speaking anxiety exist to which it can be either considered as a qualitatively distinct subtype of social phobia or a quantitatively less severe form of a more impairing generalized social phobia. However, the prevalence of public speaking fears can be regarded as high and there is considerable evidence for interference with work or education. In addition, public speaking anxiety can cause marked distress suggesting that the impairment, at least in some individuals, is high enough to warrant professional treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has turned out as an effective treatment for social phobia in general but also for public speaking anxiety. Nevertheless, some aspects hinder the successful delivery of CBT to anxious individuals. On the one hand, individuals are sometimes uncertain if the severity of their symptoms and impairment justifies professional treatment. On the other hand, groups are required for conducting exposure interventions.\n\nThis study tries to circumvent these limitations by lowering the access to treatment and by providing treatment in a group of anxious individuals. Large-group one-session treatments have been shown to be feasible in the treatment of specific phobias and fears and investigations revealed first evidence regarding their efficacy.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic makes it impossible to conduct face-to-face group sessions, so an online setting making use of a videoconference tool has been chosen.\n\nIn this study, the investigators plan to conduct an online large-group one-session treatment to reduce public speaking anxiety comprising different cognitive and behavioral techniques. First, anxiety and its function in general as well as factors causing, defining and maintaining public speaking anxiety are addressed in a psychoeducation phase. Second, different speaking tasks are conducted to expose the individuals to their feared situation on the one hand and to address common cognitive processes characterizing public speaking anxiety, e.g. self-focused attention, on the other hand. The exercises will be conducted in smaller groups.\n\nParticipants will be recruited from a community sample. They are invited to self-screen their public speaking anxiety to see if the intervention is suitable for them. The only exclusion criterion is not having the appropriate technical equipment for participation in a videoconference.\n\nPublic speaking anxiety as well as cognitive facets of social phobia will be assessed two months before treatment, two days before and one day after treatment and at one month and six months follow up to investigate long-term effects of the intervention.\n\nBesides the aim of supporting a general feasibility and efficacy of the intervention, the study focusses on the role of expectancy violation. Recent theoretical frameworks suggest that expectancy violation is the core mechanism behind successful exposure therapy. Nevertheless, only a few studies to date manipulated expectancy violation experimentally to confirm its importance. Thus, participants in this study will be randomly allocated to two different treatment conditions. After completion of the treatment, one half of the participants will elaborate a worksheet that addresses basic contentual information concerning the treatment without a specific attempt to highlight the discrepancy between anticipated and actual outcomes. For example, participants will be asked how they would explain public speaking anxiety and exposure therapy to a friend and what advantages they see in conducting treatments like this in groups (BASIC task). The other group will receive a worksheet with questions aimed at enhancing the processing of what was learned during treatment in terms of expectancy violation. For example, they are asked if what they were most worried about occured and what actually happened compared to what they predicted to happen (EV task)."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["January 1, 2021"],"CompletionDate":["October 4, 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["Comprising both groups, the investigators expect a reduction in public speaking anxiety. This effect should be present comparing pre-treatment anxiety to the anxiety reported at the assessment points directly after treatment, one month after treatment and six months after treatment. The change in reported anxiety between the two assessment time points before treatment is used as a control condition as there is no waitlist control group that is assessed but not treated. The reduction in public speaking anxiety is expected to be larger when comparing the assessments before and after treatment than in the control period before treatment. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize participants to benefit from the intervention in terms of other constructs, namely socially phobic cognitions and fear of negative evaluation.\n\nBesides the hypotheses regarding general efficacy of the intervention, the investigators expect the reduction in public speaking anxiety in the EV group to be larger than in the BASIC group. This superiority of the EV condition should be present at the assessment points directly after treatment, one month after treatment and six months after treatment.\n\nThe sample under investigation will be a sample of anxious individuals recruited from the community. All participants can attain the intervention for free and there is no payment for participation. On a website created for the project, interested parties can receive information on the project and can self-screen their public speaking anxiety and generalized social anxiety. Participation is recommended if public speaking anxiety is high and if general social phobia is low. After registration for the study, participants are asked to fill out a survey through a link sent to them via e-mail. This survey comprises all outcome measures. The same procedure is carried out two days before, one day after, one month after and six months after treatment.\n\nThe target sample size is 100 participants. The decision for that number is not based on power calculations as there was no study before that conducted an online large-group one-session intervention for the treatment of public speaking anxiety and therefore effect size estimates would be random. Instead, the target sample size can be ascribed to organizational purposes.\n\nIn terms of the general efficacy hypothesis, the primary outcome measure will be analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA covering the assessment time points after registration, two days before and one month after treatment.\n\nFor all other outcome measures, the investigators will use a rmANOVA comprising all five assessment time points, i.e. after registration, two days before the intervention, one day after the intervention, one month after the intervention and six months after the intervention. Furthermore, there will be paired comparisons between the public speaking anxiety scores at each of the assessment time points.\n\nThese analyses will be conducted not only for public speaking anxiety but also for social phobic cognitions, fear of negative evaluation and other psychological constructs such as positive mental health.\n\nRegarding the expectancy violation hypothesis, the primary outcome measure will be analyzed with a 2x3 repeated measures ANOVA. For all other outcome measures, the investigators will use 2x5 between-within repeated measures ANOVAs (rmANOVA) to analyze the results.

A conventional fMRI experiment involves the comparison of two or more brain states followed by statistical tests to identify which brain regions were involved in a particular task. The identification of patterns of highly correlated low-frequency MRI signals in the resting brain provides a powerful approach to delineate and describe neural circuits, and an unprecedented ability to assess the manner in which distributed regions work together to achieve specific functions. Since the first reports of temporal correlations in BOLD baseline signals, several distinct cortical long-range networks have been identified and characterized in the resting state, including a default mode network. Moreover, observations of altered resting state connectivity in several disorders and as a function of behavior or cognitive skills suggest these correlations reflect an important level of brain organization and may play a fundamental role in the execution and maintenance of various brain functions. DTI is also an exceedingly important imaging modality that has elucidated the neural connectivity inherent between various cortical and subcortical structures. DTI is routinely used and has enhanced our understanding of functional connections between various parts of the brain. Prior to interventions, DTI is commonly obtained, so that interventionists can avoid critical circuitry. There is suggestion that both fMRI and DTI imaging is influenced by organic or interventional variables, however this is understudied. The neuroscientists and clinicians would greatly value information that would expand our working knowledge of the basic neural substrates and functional neural changes that occur in patients organically or after interventions. A non-invasive, non-interventional, observational study is needed to show the changes that happen to patients organically or in standard of care settings. A greater working understanding of the neural connectivity and changes that happen in the brain is of great future benefit to patients, science, and society as well as future therapeutic development such as post-stroke care, rehabilitation, post-traumatic brain injury, or post-treatment care in the brain that has previously been influenced by intervention or disease."],"EnrollmentCount":["50"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["Yes"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":[]},{"Rank":738,"NCTId":["NCT04337242"],"OfficialTitle":["Blended Care Psychodynamic Therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Versus Face-to-Face Psychotherapy for Depression: A Pragmatic Multicenter Randomized Controlled Non-inferiority Trial"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Depression is a severe mental disorder that affects 5-7% of Belgians each year.

Epidemiological research shows that depression is underrecognized and underdiagnosed in Belgium, resulting in very high unmet needs, with more than 50% of patients not seeking professional help in the first year after onset and often taking patients up to 10 years and more to effectively seek professional help (Bruffaerts et al., 2007, 2008). The current lack of capacity of mental health services in Belgium is a major obstacle in attempts to increase access to effective psychotherapy for depression. Centers for Mental Health Care ('Centra Geestelijke Gezondheidszorg', CGGs) in particular are faced with a growing number of patients (+3% per year). Despite their efforts (e.g., by offering more group-based psychotherapy and interventions), CGGs in Belgium are faced with increasingly longer waiting lists. There is therefore an urgent need for (cost-)effective, time-saving interventions in the mental health care system in Belgium.\n\nBoth pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy alone or in combination have been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression, and meta-analyses have shown no substantial differences in the efficacy of two of the empirically most validated types of brief face-to-face (FTF) psychotherapy in major depression, i.e., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic Therapy (PDT) (Cuijpers et al., 2013; Cuijpers, Van Straten, Van Oppen, & Andersson, 2008; Driessen et al., 2015; Luyten & Blatt, 2012; Munder et al., 2018). Moreover, meta-analyses and qualitative reviews converge to suggest that internet-based interventions, particularly offered as blended care (combining face-to-face sessions with internet-based modules), may be equally effective as FTF psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in major depression both at treatment termination and at follow-up in the medium to long-term, suggesting non-inferiority (Andersson, Cuijpers, Carlbring, Riper, & Hedman, 2014). Extant research in this domain also suggests that both CBT and PDT delivered through the internet may be effective in depression. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that internet-based psychotherapy if combined with therapist support may be more cost-effective as it typically reduces the number of face-to-face contacts, without compromising the effectiveness of psychotherapy (Andersson, Titov, Dear, Rozental, & Carlbring, 2019). Hence, the implementation of blended care may lead to increased availability of psychotherapy for depression and a more effective use of resources in mental health care, at least for a subsample of depressed patients.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is therefore to investigate the non-inferiority (defined as a small-sized difference in effect size (Cohen's d= .20) of blended PDT and CBT for depression compared to FTF PDT and CBT in adults diagnosed with major depressive disorder (n=504) in the context of a pragmatic, multicenter randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to one of four conditions (i.e., blended PDT, blended CBT, FTF PDT, or FTF CBT). The primary outcome is changes in the severity of depression as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) at 6 months follow-up (approximately 12 months after the start of treatment).\n\nIn addition, this study will investigate the comparative efficacy of blended care versus FTF psychotherapy on the following secondary outcomes: severity of depression as measured with the BDI-II at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up; recovery from depression as assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM 5 disorders - Clinical Trials Version (SCID-5-CT; American Psychiatric Association) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up; and quality of life as measured with the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L; Herdman et al., 2011) at treatment termination, and at 6-month, and one- and two-year follow-up.\n\nFurthermore, this study will also examine possible predictors of treatment response in blended care versus FTF therapy, such as severity of depression (BDI-II, PHQ-9), psychiatric co-morbidity (SCID-5-CT), and patients' experience of both types of treatment as assessed with the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ; Devilly & Borkovec, 2000). In addition, the feasibility of implementing blended care in mental health care centers in Flanders, Belgium, will be investigated. To this end, we will record recruitment rate, retention in treatment, treatment adherence, and adherence to the research protocol. Acceptability will be indicated by the number of sessions attended, including the number of individuals who refuse treatment, and feasibility by the number of patients failing to comply with the full clinical and research protocol. Patients will also complete very brief measures of credibility of the treatments and satisfaction with the treatments. Treatment integrity of therapists will be assessed on the basis of independent ratings of audio or video recorded psychotherapy sessions, applying a treatment integrity instrument developed in the UK specifically for the treatments used in this study (Lemma, Target, & Fonagy, 2011).\n\nFinally, provided blended care is non-inferior to FTF therapy, the cost-effectiveness of blended care versus FTF psychotherapy will be investigated from a societal perspective, i.e., taking all relevant costs and effects into account (intervention costs, direct and indirect medical costs, as well as productivity losses and costs made elsewhere in the health care system). To this end, patients will complete the Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment (iMTA) Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness (TIC-P; Bouwmans et al., 2013). Moreover, health care use data for all patients will be provided by the Rijksinstituut voor Ziekte- en Invaliditeitsverzekering (RIZIV).\n\nReferences\n\nAndersson, G., Cuijpers, P., Carlbring, P., Riper, H., & Hedman, E.

In addition, the effect of the newly developed training program on motor and cognitive functions is examined. This study is a national study. The development of the exergame was carried out at the Fraunhofer AICOS research center in Portugal and further studies are being conducted in international collaboration with the University of Montréal in Canada, KU Leuven in Belgium and ETH Zurich. The Exergame consists of a video game based training, which is performed with step movements. These movements are detected by two sensors on the feet. The video game should make the training fun and motivate to train. The training will include specific cognitive and physical functions. Special emphasis will be put on a continuous interaction and integration of motor and cognitive functions. An intact cognitive-motor interaction as well as balance and strength form the basis for all everyday performances, especially for safe and accident-free movement in older adults. In the Exergame VITAAL, balance is trained with step-based games. Strength, especially leg strength, is trained through Tai-Chi-like movements/exercises.\n\nThe pelvic floor training takes place using a vaginal probe that measures the contractions of the pelvic floor. The training games on the VITAAL Exergame have been adapted for this purpose and are controlled via the probe.\n\nAll participants receive an individually tailored training session that is optimally adapted to their needs based on the results of the pre-measurement. Participants with urinary incontinence also receive an integrated pelvic floor training. The study includes 32-52 seniors with mobility impairments and 8-28 older adults with urinary incontinence. Balance and strength, gait pattern, cognitive functions and pelvic floor specific functions will be measured before and after the training in order to detect any changes. The training should be carried out during 12 weeks, with a maximum of two weeks break/holidays. There are two measurement dates with all examinations, whereby one measurement date lasts approx. 1.5 hours. All study participants can continue their everyday life as usual."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["October 26, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["October 2021"],"DetailedDescription":["The VITAAL exergame is an individualized multicomponent exergame training based mostly on the prevention and slowing of physical and cognitive decline and its consequences. It mainly consists of three (four with UI) components; strength training, balance training, cognitive training and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) when suffering from UI. For strength training, Tai Chi-inspired movements are included which are a combination of classical strength exercises and Tai Chi movements. Since Tai Chi is mainly performed in a semi-squat posture it places a large load on the muscles of the lower extremities. For balance training, step-based training is included in the VITAAL exergame, as the execution of rapid and well directed steps has been shown to be effective in preventing falls. Both, Tai Chi-inspired exercises and step-based exercises, combined with challenging game tasks, provide a 'holistic' physical activity requiring motor functions, cognition and mental involvement. The PFMT is divided in two categories, isolated exercises of PFM (different contraction sequences) and dual task exercises, where PFM contractions are performed with or in combination with balance exercises. Moreover, Tai Chi-inspired training, step-based training and PFMT could be more motivating and joyful than standard exercises. Some cognitive training is already included in these training components as they represent simultaneous cognitive-motor interaction and require motor and cognitive functions. But specific attentional and executive functions are important for walking abilities and safe gait. Therefore, the VITAAL exergame explicitly targets on these neuropsychological functions (selective attention, divided attention, inhibition/interference control, mental flexibility, working memory). To maximize benefits for participants, the VITAAL exergame implements some basic general training principles; providing feedback, optimal load of task demands, progression of difficulty and high variability.\n\nIntervention group MI:\n\nThe VITAAL exergame intervention for MI includes 36 training sessions with three sessions per week, each lasting around 45 minutes (30 minutes real training time) resulting in 12 weeks of training (two weeks of break/holiday allowed). The time frame and training intensity is based upon studies illustrating positive training effects in older adults performing exergame training. A training session includes an individually calculated amount of strength, cognitive-motor and balance training, which remains the same over the 12 week intervention period. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants are allowed to continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The training takes place at Physio SPArtos in Interlaken, Bern. They get well instructed on how to set up and use the system at the physio centre. The first two training sessions will be supervised one to one, after that someone will observe the training every 4 weeks to make adjustments and support the participants. The other training sessions will be done without supervision. However, there will be a physiotherapist available in case questions come up or help is needed. The compliance with the exergame training will be monitored using an attendance protocol filled in by participants.\n\nIntervention group UI:\n\nFor the incontinent women in this study, the VITAAL exergame intervention will last over 12 weeks and consists of three parts 1) VITAAL exergame (2 sessions/week) lasting 45 minutes each (30 minutes real training time) at the physio centre, 2) PFM exercises according to a training booklet (3 sessions/week) lasting 10 minutes each at home and 3) education related to UI at home.. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants will be allowed to continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The training will take place at the physio centre SPArtos, Interlaken, Switzerland and their home. Women will get instructed on how to set up and use the system at the centre and how to do the PFM exercises at home. The VITAAL exergame training sessions will be supervised. Furthermore, every fourth week the additional weight for the strength training will be adjusted. However; the participants will be encouraged to use the system as independently as possible. The compliance with the exergame training will be monitored using an attendance protocol filled in by participants. For both groups, training compliance will be followed online by the investigators in the Web portal as each participant will have a personal login and training data will be stored in the internet-based back-end.\n\nControl group MI:\n\nParticipants of the MI control group are instructed to do a non-individualized conventional training including 15 minutes walking exercise (in nature or on treadmill) and additional 15 minutes of strength, balance, and cognitive-motor exercises (at the therapy centre or at home). The exercises are based on recommendations from the \"Beratungsstelle für Unfallverhütung\" (bfu). The participants will receive a training booklet with the exercises. In total there are three different training programs which are divided according to their level of difficulty. Participants are instructed to start with the first level for four weeks and then go on to the next level for another 4 weeks. The control group training in this study includes 36 training session with three sessions per week, each lasting around 45 minutes resulting in 12 weeks of training (two weeks of break/holiday allowed). Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants are allowed to continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The first training sessions take place at Physio SPArtos in Interlaken, whereas the walking can be made outside or on a treadmill. The participants get well instructed on how to do the training at the centre or at home. There will always be a supervisor at the training centre to further help and support the participants with any questions and issues. Furthermore, participants will be called every 4 weeks, to ensure social contact similar to that in the intervention group. The training components will not be individually adapted for this group. Participants in this groups will report their trainings in an attendance protocol and their additional activity in an activity protocol. In addition they need to rate the exercise intensity on each session with Borg scale.\n\nControl group UI:\n\nThe control group training will last over 12 weeks. The training sessions will be divided in three parts 1) 30 minutes of brisk walking (2 sessions/week, 2) PFM exercises according to a training booklet (3 sessions/week) lasting 10 minutes each at home and 3) education related to UI at home. The PFM training booklet will be based on two studies that showed a reduction of incontinence in older adults while performing group pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and mobility exercises. The PFMT program will consist of 4 PFM exercises and will be divided into three phases allowing for the gradual progression in treatment (from first to third month), with gradual increase in difficult exercises in terms of duration, repetition and position. Each phase will last four weeks. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants will be allowed to continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The first training sessions take place at the physio centre SPArtos, Interlaken, whereas the walking can be made outside or on a treadmill. The participants get well instructed on how to do the training at home. Furthermore, participants will be called every 4 weeks, to ensure social contact similar to that in the intervention group.

More than 380,000 patients suffer out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) each year in the US. Improvements in cardiac resuscitation (the early links in the \"chain of survival\" for patients with OHCA) are tempered by our limited ability to resuscitate and protect the brain from global cerebral ischemia.\n\nNeurological death and disability are common outcomes in survivors of cardiac arrest. Therapeutic cooling of comatose patients resuscitated from shockable rhythms markedly increases the rate of good neurological outcome, but poor outcomes still occur in as many as 50%, and the benefit of cooling in those resuscitated from asystole and pulseless electrical activity has not been shown in a randomized study.\n\nObjectives:\n\nThe overarching goal of this project is to identify clinical strategies that will increase the number of patients with good neurological recovery from cardiac arrest. We hypothesize that longer durations of cooling may improve either the proportion of patients that attain a good neurological recovery or may result in better recovery among the proportion already categorized as having good outcomes.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nA. To determine, in each of two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (those with initial shockable rhythms and those with pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole), the shortest duration of cooling that provides the maximum treatment effect as determined by a weighted 90 day modified Rankin score B. To determine, in each of two populations of adult comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (those with initial shockable rhythms and those with PEA/asystole), whether increasing durations of cooling are associated with better outcomes or recovery implying efficacy of hypothermia to no cooling.\n\nSecondary Objectives:\n\nTo characterize the overall safety and adverse events associated with duration of cooling To characterize the effect of duration of cooling on neuropsychological outcomes To characterize the effect of duration of cooling on patient reported quality of life\n\nDesign:\n\nThis study is a randomized, response-adaptive, duration (dose) finding, comparative effectiveness clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment. The design is based on a statistical model of response as defined by the primary endpoint, a weighted 90-day mRS, across the treatment arms. The design will fit patient outcome data to a duration response model (separately for shockable and non-shockable rhythms), in which the potentially non-linear association between durations of cooling and the primary endpoint are estimated. All conclusions about the treatment arms are based on this model. The functional form of the duration-response model is flexible and able to fit many different shapes for the duration-response curve. Specifically it is parameterized to identify up to two change-points in the treatment effect across arms, allowing it to fit an increasing, decreasing, flat, plateau, or U-shape duration-response curve.\n\nSubjects will initially be equally randomized between 12, 24, and 48 hours of cooling. After the first 200 subjects have been randomized, additional treatment arms between 12 and 48 hours will be opened and patients will be allocated, within each rhythm type, by response adaptive randomization. As the trial continues, shorter and longer duration arms may be opened. Specifically, a 6-hour duration arm will be opened if the emerging duration-response curve from 12 hours is flat. Similarly, a 60-hour or 72-hour duration arm will be opened if the emerging duration response curve shows an increasing treatment benefit through 48 hours.\n\nThis trial will have frequent interim analyses to stop the trial early for futility if it is highly likely that no treatment arm offers a greater benefit then the 6-hour duration arm.\n\nPrimary Outcome Measure:\n\nThe primary outcome measure will be the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after return of spontaneous circulation. The mRS will be analyzed as a weighted score incorporating both the proportion of subjects achieving a good neurological outcome and degree of residual functional impairment among those with good neurological outcomes.\n\nStudy Population:\n\nComatose adult survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest that have already been rapidly cooled using a definitive temperature control method (endovascular or surface) will be enrolled in the emergency department or intensive care unit. Hub and spoke hospitals from the SIREN network will be enriched with high potential ancillary Hubs. Approximately 50 hospitals are anticipated to each enroll an average of 9 subjects per year.\n\nRandomization:\n\nCentral computerized randomization by web-based interface will be used. Subjects will be potentially randomized over the course of the trial to the following possible durations of cooling (in hours): 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, and 72. The first 200 patients will be randomized 1:1:1 to the 12, 24, and 48-hour durations only. After this initial \"burn in\" period, response adaptive randomization will be used to allocate subjects to durations inclusive of 12 to 48 hours initially, and then subsequently to the 6, 60 or 72 hour durations if specified conditions are met and the emerging duration-response curve suggests that the maximum treatment benefit might be on those durations. The response adaptive randomization probabilities for each arm will be determined separately for the two rhythm type populations. Randomization probabilities will be updated monthly, or approximately every 38 patients based on the expected accrual rate.\n\nConsent:\n\nEligible patients for this trial will not have capacity to provide informed consent. Written informed consent from a legally authorized representative will be required.\n\nIntervention:\n\nThe intervention will be random allocation to duration of cooling after cardiac arrest. Cooling in the study will be by a definitive temperature control method to a target temperature of 33 deg C. Any endovascular or surface cooling system with closed loop feedback will be allowed. Duration of cooling will be measured from the time that cooling with a definitive device is initiated in the hospital. As part of routine medical care, cooling may be initiated by emergency medical service (EMS) or in the emergency department. Eligibility will require that a temperature of <34 degrees C be obtained by 240 minutes after cardiac arrest. After the allocated duration of cooling is completed, controlled rewarming will be performed. Rewarming to a temperature of 36.5 deg C will occur over the shorter of 24 hours or a rewarming period equal to the allocated duration of cooling. Definitive cooling devices may be used for maintenance of normothermia after rewarming is complete. A clinical standardization guideline will be followed to reduce the effects of practice variability. Key physiologic and practice variables will be tracked and compliance with clinical standardization and deviation from physiologic targets reported back to study teams.\n\nStatistical Analysis for the Primary Outcome Measure:\n\nWe will model the mean weighted mRS at 90 days across the treatment arms. The weighted mRS incorporates both the proportion of subjects achieving a good neurological outcome and degree of impairment among those with good neurological outcomes. The primary analysis is conducted separately for each rhythm type, allowing for a different treatment effect by rhythm type, and has two components. First, we identify the most likely target duration, where the target duration is the shortest duration that achieves the maximum treatment effect (Objective A). Second, we calculate whether the efficacy of any duration is superior to any shorter duration of cooling indicating a positive duration response (Objective B). Establishing a positive duration response implies confirmation that cooling is effective in improving outcome or recovery versus normothermia, when a normothermia control arm is not clinically acceptable.\n\nA maximal sample size of 1800 subjects enrolled over 4 years (estimated accrual rate of 37.5 subjects/month) is anticipated.\n\nInvestigational Device Exemption"],"EnrollmentCount":["1800"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["Yes"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":747,"NCTId":["NCT04705389"],"OfficialTitle":["SerUM Markers in MERkel Cell Carcinoma Patients: a Longitudinal moniTorIng Study for optiMization of European Guidelines"],"OverallStatus":["Not yet recruiting"],"Phase":["Not Applicable"],"BriefSummary":["Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare aggressive skin carcinoma. Approximately 80% of MCC are related to the Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCPyV). Although rates of relapse are high, the follow-up strategy lacks consensus. Patients are usually assessed clinically every 3 to 6 months for the first 2-3 years, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter. In the European guidelines, patients with early stages are monitored with clinical examination and ultrasonography of lymph nodes, while whole-body imaging is optional in patients with stage III disease, on a yearly basis for 5 years. Such strategy may prevent the diagnosis of infra-clinical recurrences, whereas patients could still be treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Until 2017, patients with advanced disease were treated with chemotherapies, with no long-term benefit. Immunotherapies with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors currently allow durable responses in 50% of such patients. This major change in the management of MCC patients argues for a follow-up strategy that would allow early diagnosis of infra-clinical metastases, when tumoral burden is still low. Given that all patients cannot be monitored by systematic regular imaging, additional non-invasive tools are needed. Blood-based biomarkers as a surrogate of tumor burden are advantageous as they can be repeated over time, providing guidance on when imaging is necessary.

However, HSCT is associated with three major risks: graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and opportunistic, mostly viral, infections or reactivations resulting from delayed immune reconstitution. Delayed immune reconstitution, however, often is the direct result of the severe pre-transplantation conditioning treatment and T-cell depletion of the transplant necessary to fight the risks of graft rejection and GvHD. Therefore, the risk for life-threatening opportunistic, mostly viral, infections is increased in post-transplantation patients. The most common infections after HSCT are Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Adenovirus (AdV).\n\nThe standard treatment approach for viral infections/reactivations is chemotherapy which shows limited efficacy and does not restore immunity. Therefore, effective new treatment options are required for this condition.\n\nPrevious investigations have shown that sufficient T-cell immunity is essential for the control and prevention of viral reactivations and newly occurring infections after HSCT. The infusion of T-cells is therefore a promising new approach to treat immune-comprised patients. However, infusion with unselected T cells is associated with an increased risk for GvHD due to the high content of alloreactive T cells. A very promising approach to minimize this problem is to remove alloreactive T cells and enrich, isolate and purify virus-specific T cells.\n\nThis approach has been studied for nearly two decades and the data published up to date indicate that virus-specific T-cell responses after adoptive T-cell transfer protect against virus-related complications post HSCT and restore T-cell immunity, in particular for AdV-, CMV- and EBV-infections. Despite these promising results, virus-specific T-cell transfer is not yet translated into daily clinical practice due to the lack of prospective clinical trials confirming the efficacy of this treatment approach.\n\nThe overall goal of this Phase III, double-blind placebo-controlled study is to test efficacy of multivirus-specific T cells to bring this treatment method in clinical routine. Multivirus-specific T cells generated in this study will be directed against all three most common post-HSCT viral infections: AdV, CMV and EBV. Thus, T-cell immunity will be restored to fight and prevent new viral infections.\n\nAfter an initial screening visit, patients eligible to participate in the study will be treated within 28 days after screening. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 (treatment: placebo) ratio and receive a single infusion with either multivirus-specific T cells or placebo. Patients will be followed up on the day of treatment, 1 day after and 1, 2, 4, 8 and 15 weeks after treatment. Treatment success will be measured by assessing different parameters including symptoms, quality of life, viral load and T-cell immunity in blood samples.\n\nPatients eligible to participate in this study are adult and paediatric patients who have received allogeneic stem cell transplantation and suffer from new or reactivated EBV, AdV or CMV infection refractory to standard antiviral treatment for two weeks.

As a result of this event, there is an inflammatory response in the recipient elicited by the transplanted organ.\n\nAt the present time, immunosuppressive treatments are routinely used to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. Although effective in this goal, there is currently an unmet need to develop new strategies to control the innate inflammatory responses and to reduce the injury caused to the organs being transplanted.\n\nThe investigators propose a novel approach to the management of this inflammatory response. The investigators will explore the \"cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway\" as a potential target, a pathway first characterized in the basic science laboratories of the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. In short, the vagus nerve activates the splenic nerve which activates choline acetyltransferase expressing T cells in the spleen. Stimulation of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR) on macrophages by acetylcholine reduces production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines.\n\nCurrently, vagus nerve stimulation is used to treat a number of human diseases, including epilepsy, depression and migraine headaches. Many of these treatments activate the vagus nerve non-invasively by stimulating a branch of the vagus that innervates the ear. In this study, the investigators will stimulate this branch of the vagus nerve, and look for changes in inflammatory markers in the blood of kidney transplant recipients of both live and deceased donors.\n\nSuccessful completion of this study will allow for future studies in organ transplant recipients."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["January 13, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2022"],"DetailedDescription":["Intervention and comparators:\n\nPatients will receive transcutaneous stimulation of the auricular branch of the left vagus nerve for 5 minutes in the OR already under anesthesia. Subjects will be blinded to their treatment arm.\n\nThe device to be used will include a handheld electrical pulse generator and a pair of electrodes to be placed at the ear for stimulation. The specific target at the ear will be the auricular branch of the vagus nerve which innervates the skin overlying the cymba conchae of the ear canal.\n\nAnatomical landmarks and cutaneous innervation of the external ear. Three nerves contribute to the cutaneous innervation of the lateral aspect of the ear: the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN), the auriculotemporal nerve (ATN) and the great auricular nerve (GAN). There is a variable degree of overlap in the distribution of these cutaneous nerves.\n\nElectrodes will be placed near/at the entrance to the canal of the ear to provide stimulation to the auricular branch. The handheld electrical pulse generator (e.g. Roscoe Medical, TENS 7000) will be programmed to deliver stimulation pulses to the electrodes. The electrodes will be made of conductive material facilitating trans-cutaneous electrical stimulation. All subjects will be told that they may or may not sense the stimulation.\n\nAttempts to diminish pain associated with blood drawing will be made by performing whenever possible the phlebotomy coincident with other blood drawing requirements or while the patient is under anesthesia.\n\nThe investigators will administer transcutaneous electrical stimulation to the left ears for 5 minutes. Subjects receiving auricular stimulation will receive stimulation using the following parameters: 0.300 milliseconds (msec) stimulus peaks at a frequency of 30 Hz for five (5) minutes, with peak current pulse amplitude set to 1.5 milliamps (mA). Research subjects will receive hemodynamic monitoring and heart rate variability monitoring while undergoing vagal stimulation as a routine part of the underlying care for organ procurement or anesthesia management.\n\nTranscutaneous electrical stimulation Electrical auricular stimulation is accomplished using a Roscoe Medical TENS 7000 that delivers a programmable electrical current density, frequency, and pulse width. The TENS 7000 will be connected to ear clip (or hand held) electrodes to transcutaneously stimulate the cymba conchae of the ear to activate the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (diagram above), also known as Arnold's nerve, which provides sensory innervation to the skin surrounding the ear canal. Through a neural reflex arc, activation of this sensory nerve sends a neural signal to the brainstem that then activates the efferent vagus nerve through the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). This is a well-described and clinically accepted neuromodulatory pathway, as transcutaneous electrical auricular stimulation has been studied to treat seizures, similarly to how invasive electrical vagus nerve stimulation has been approved by the FDA for the past two decades for the same indication. Currently, transcutaneous electrical auricular stimulation is approved in Europe for the treatment of seizures.\n\nThe scientific basis for these specific choices comes from more than 10 years of experience performing experimental vagus nerve stimulation in animals to control bleeding at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research. The frequency of stimulus peaks will be 30 Hz. The pulse width of the individual stimulus peaks will be 0.300 milliseconds (msec). The total duration of stimulation will be five (5) minutes. For the remaining stimulation parameter, which is the peak current pulse amplitude, the investigators will use 1.5 milliamps (mA). These stimulation parameters are very similar to parameters previously demonstrated to be safe in two separate tinnitus studies (6, 7). A portable, battery-powered oscilloscope will be used to confirm peak current.\n\nSafety procedures Recent assessments of cardiac safety following transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the auricular branch of the vagus nerve have revealed no indication of arrhythmic effects of tVNS (6, 7).\n\nIn the exceedingly rare instance that a research subject develops a symptomatic bradyarrhythmia, qualified personnel anesthesiologists/surgeons/residents/CRNA) will be immediately available to administer any therapies (intravenous fluid, anti-arrhythmic medications, cardioversion) to treat the bradyarrhythmia and its associated symptoms."],"EnrollmentCount":["40"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Basic Science"]},{"Rank":753,"NCTId":["NCT01190579"],"OfficialTitle":["Multicenter Evaluation of Coronary Dual Source CT Angiography in Patients With Intermediate Risk of Coronary Artery Stenoses"],"OverallStatus":["Unknown status"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["The trial will investigate the accuracy of Dual Source CT coronary angiography to detect coronary artery stenoses in patients with chest pain who have, based on clinical criteria, an intermediate likelihood for the presence of coronary artery stenoses.

This often works because cancers cells grow faster than many normal cells, many treatments are aimed at to take advantage of that difference. One of the ways to do this is to damage the DNA of these more rapidly growing cells. However, if the cells have a way of repairing that damage then therapies may not work as well. Some research shows that when specific changes or mutations occur in the genes involved with repairing DNA damage, resulting cancers have responded well to drugs which damage DNA.\n\nOlaparib is known as a PARP inhibitor and is standard of care therapy for men with BRCA altered mCRPC. Carboplatin is a synthetic antineoplastic agent which has been used in the treatment of solid tumors and BRCA related cancers.

Lastly, the study will compare the pre-treatment and at-progression metastatic tumor biopsies to investigate the molecular correlates of resistance and sensitivity to pembrolizumab via RNA-sequencing, exome-sequencing, selected protein analyses, and multiplexed immunofluorescence."],"CollaboratorName":["Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC"],"StartDate":["February 20, 2020"],"CompletionDate":["March 31, 2023"],"DetailedDescription":["Research Plan:\n\nThis is a single-arm, open-label phase II study that examines the response rate of pembrolizumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who have either a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or a biallelic inactivation of CDK12 (CDK12-/-). The study will enroll mCRPC patients who have the selected genetic mutation and at least one metastatic lesion that is amendable to biopsy. All patients must have progressed on at least one prior line of mCRPC therapy, such as abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide. Eligible patients will undergo at least 12 weeks (4 cycles) of pembrolizumab (200 mg IV).\n\nMethodology:\n\nPatients with either a mismatch repair deficiency or biallelic inactivation of CDK12 in their tumor are eligible for this study. If the patient has progressed on at least one prior therapy for mCRPC, including abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, he is eligible to begin genetic screening. Patients with these mutations will be identified primarily through standard of care genetic testing with either archival tissue or blood. Specimens will be sent to VA approved vendors for genetic testing to determine if the patient has the necessary mutations to receive the study drug (pembrolizumab). If eligible, the patient will sign the Main Treatment ICF and proceed with the screening procedures. Once enrolled the patient will undergo a biopsy of a metastatic lesion (baseline biopsy) to identify molecular correlates. If the patient does not have any archival tissue or blood to be used to identify genetic mutations, the biopsy of a metastatic lesion will be used to both identify genetic mutations and to identify molecular correlates.\n\nWhen the patient has met all the eligibility criteria, he will receive pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab will be administered at a starting dose of 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the treatment, patients will either simultaneously receive a GnRH analogue or undergo a bilateral orchiectomy prior to treatment to maintain a castrate level of testosterone ( 50 ng/dl). At progression, patients will undergo a second biopsy of the same metastatic lesion of the baseline biopsy. The baseline (pre-treatment) and at-progression biopsies will be used for correlative analyses to determine the efficacy of pembrolizumab.\n\nNote: after the testing process is complete, Oncoplex will return any remaining sample back to the Department of Pathology at the West LA VA Medical Center. These specimens will be stored in Dr. Matthew Rettig's biorepository on site for analysis and future research.\n\nResults:\n\nSince this is a new study, the results have not yet been obtained. The primary endpoint of this study is to measure the objective response rate, radiographic progression free survival at 6 months, and decline in PSA of 50% or more 12 weeks of therapy.\n\nClinical Significance:\n\nThere are 230,000 new incidences of prostate cancer and 30,000 deaths from prostate cancer per year in the US. It is the second most common cause of death in American men. Importantly, prostate cancer is diagnosed in more than 12,000 US Veterans each year, representing nearly one third of all cancer diagnoses in Veterans.\n\nMetastatic prostate cancer is incurable, and its treatment is palliative. However, many Veterans with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progress despite experiencing some clinical benefit from hormonal therapy and chemotherapy. As a result, novel therapies that provide a robust clinical benefit and have a good safety profile are needed for these patients.\n\nImmunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitor, for mCRPC patients that have either a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or a biallelic inactivation of CDK12 (CDK12-/-) is an attractive therapy, especially since therapies involving checkpoint inhibitors have exhibited significant improvements in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and many other cancers. The results of this study will establish the ideal subset of mCRPC patients who will benefit from the study drug. Importantly, the correlative studies will provide critical insight into the mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance that occur despite selection of patients with CDK12-/- or dMMR. This result can inform further selection of patients for checkpoint inhibition, as well as identify other potential therapies that can be co-administered with pembrolizumab to prevent or overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors."],"EnrollmentCount":["30"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["Yes"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Treatment"]},{"Rank":784,"NCTId":["NCT04042740"],"OfficialTitle":["Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir Fixed-dose Combination Treatment for Acute Hepatitis C Virus Infection (PURGE-C)"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":["Phase 2"],"BriefSummary":["The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a fixed dose combination (FDC) of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) given for 4 weeks in acute hepatitis C (HCV)-infected participants, with or without HIV-1 coinfection."],"CollaboratorName":["AbbVie","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)"],"StartDate":["November 15, 2019"],"CompletionDate":["December 31, 2023"],"DetailedDescription":["The study will be conducted in two steps.

Effective and safe resection of larger polyps is particularly important due to their higher potential of malignancy. Large polyps ≥20mm are removed by so-called endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) (and occasionally endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD)) using electrocautery snares. Resection of these large polyps is associated with a risk of severe complications that may require hospitalization and additional interventions. The most common risk is delayed bleeding which is observed in approximately 2-10% of patients. In a recent randomized trial, clipping has been shown to reduce bleeding esp. on the right colonic side.

We hypothesize that EndoClot™ application will reduce the risk of delayed bleeding by at least 3/4 (i.e. from 7.5% to 1.5%) based on an initial assumption of a 7.5% delayed bleeding rate."],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["August 18, 2021"],"CompletionDate":["November 30, 2023"],"DetailedDescription":["Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States and Europe. The effectiveness of colonoscopy in reducing the risk of dying from colorectal cancer relies on the detection and safe resection of neoplastic polyps to prevent incident cancers. Most polyps are small and can be easily removed using snare with or without electrocautery. Because the risk of prevalent cancer or transition to cancer increases with polyp size, effective and safe resection of large polyps is particularly important.\n\nEndoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is evolving as the primary endoscopic technique to remove large non-pedunculated polyps. These flat or sessile polyps are defined as lateral spreading tumors with a low vertical axis that extend laterally along the luminal wall. Several mostly retrospective studies from Europe, the U.S. and Japan, have demonstrated a high \"cure\" rate, with results lending credence to the shift from surgical resection to endoscopic management of these lesions. Of concern, however, is 1) a fairly high overall complication rate of 8-26% in prospective studies3-7, and 2) as well the persistence of residual neoplasia on follow-up endoscopy ranging from 16% to 46%3, 6, 8. The former is the main topic of the present study.\n\nSevere complications including bleeding associated with a standard diagnostic or screening colonoscopy, which may include resection of predominantly smaller polyps, are uncommon. Significant bleeding occurs in 0.2 to 0.5% of patients (defined as a 2mg drop in Hemoglobin) 9, 10. The risk of severe complications increases with polyp size; here, again, the most common complication is bleeding reported in 2 to 24% of polyp resections. In one recent analysis the rate of delayed bleeding in colonic EMR was 7.5%1.\n\nIn addition to size, other factors may affect complications. These include type of resection (piecemeal versus en-bloc), polyp location (right colon with a thinner wall than the left colon), age and comorbidities, especially those that affect clotting abilities (e.g. renal insufficiency, liver disease, use of anticoagulation). Studies that have examined variables, which may directly decrease the risk of complications associated with large polyp resection, are limited.\n\nIt is apparent that resection of a large polyp leaves behind a large mucosal defect. The mucosal ulcer that forms after polyp resection can take several weeks to heal. Bleeding complications typically occur within 7 to 10 days, requiring often admission, a repeat colonoscopy to stop bleeding, and possible blood transfusions. The rates depend on size, and have been shown to be around 1.5%-2.6% overall. It is significantly higher in larger adenomas of 2 cm and more, namely 6.5% in another recent meta analysis.\n\nTo reduce the risk of bleeding various measures have been proposed which also have been summarized in several recent meta analyses. These include coagulation, clipping and others, but only few randomized trials are available: Coagulation not effective in a recent meta analysis14, but only 4 of the 12 studies were randomized and these included all mostly smaller polyps or polyps of all sizes or pedunculated polyps. In a recent randomized trial, clipping has been shown to reduce bleeding esp. on the right colonic side. However, clipping of larger areas is time consuming and may add to costs in several ways.\n\nOur primary aim is to examine whether EndoClot™ application (a special form of longer lasting spray on the mucosal defect after EMR/ESD of large non-pedunculated colorectal polyps (≥20mm) will reduce the risk of delayed bleeding. We hypothesize that EndoClot™ application will reduce the risk of delayed bleeding by at least 3/4 (i.e. from 7.5% to 1.5%) based on an initial assumption of a 7.5% delayed bleeding rate."],"EnrollmentCount":["440"],"IsFDARegulatedDevice":["No"],"IsFDARegulatedDrug":["No"],"DesignPrimaryPurpose":["Prevention"]},{"Rank":793,"NCTId":["NCT03953846"],"OfficialTitle":["A Long-term Non-interventional Registry Study to Assess the Effectiveness and Safety of the NUsurface® Meniscus Implant"],"OverallStatus":["Recruiting"],"Phase":[],"BriefSummary":["The purpose of this active post-market surveillance clinical registry study is to further characterize the therapeutic effect, the long-term safety and effectiveness of the NUsurface® meniscus implant in the real-world post-marketing setting"],"CollaboratorName":[],"StartDate":["June 1, 2019"],"CompletionDate":["June 1, 2033"],"DetailedDescription":["Patients eligible for the Registry includes any patient who received or is scheduled to receive the NUsurface® meniscus implant and meets the Registry inclusion criteria (Evidence of a personally signed and dated informed consent document).
