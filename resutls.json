Peak strain is a measure of distortion in the heart muscle during contraction versus when it is at rest. Mid-ventricular peak circumferential strain is a sensitive marker of cardiac function and can detect effects of therapeutic interventions. Strain is expressed in the negative, so more negative measurements indicate a healthy state while less negative measurements (closer to zero) indicate an unhealthy state."

It consists of 17 activities graded 0 (unable to perform), 1 (performs with modifications), 2 (normal movement). The scale assesses activities required to remain functionally ambulant (e.g. rise from the floor), activities that can be difficult even early in the disease (e.g. standing on heels) and activities that are known to progressively deteriorate over time (stand from a chair, walk). NSAA total score was achieved by adding the responses of all activities, ranging from 0 to 34, with a score of 34 implying normal function and lower score implying more severe symptoms. Baseline was defined as participants randomization assessment at Visit 3 (Day 0). Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the value at Week 48.

These responses are ranked on a scale of 0 to 4, (0=unable to do, 4=no difficulty). Subscale scores are determined by dividing the weighted answers by the maximum possible weighted score and multiplying by 100. Each score ranges from 0-100 with lower scores indicating lower performance. The overall score is the average of all 3 subscores.",

Each question has 3 levels of severity, corresponding to no problems, moderate problems and severe problems. Canadian population sample weights were used to derive health utility scores. A higher utility score represents a better health state. A clinically meaningful improvement or worsening was defined as at least 0.08 points of improvement or 0.10 points of worsening from baseline, respectively, for the EQ-5D-3L Health Utility Index. The EQ-5D-3L is scored using the UK index ranges from -0.594 to 1, where 0 equates to death and 1 equates to full health; -0.594 is considered 'worse than death'.",

The TUG assesses functional mobility by assessing an individual's ability to stand up, walk 3 meters at a comfortable pace, turn 180 degrees, walk 3 meters, and sit down (Shumway-Cook, Brauer, & Woollacott, 2000). The TUG test has been shown the excellent reliability and validity in stroke population and the minimal detectable change (MDC) is 2.9 seconds (Flansbjer, Holmback, Downham, Patten, & Lexell, 2005). Two practice trials of the TUG will be allowed to familiarize the participant with the task. TUG is a valid method for screening of functional mobility and risk for falls in community-dwelling elderly people(Shumway-Cook et al., 2000)."

It is a 16-items self-reported measuring fear of falling in older adults and people with chronic conditions. Each item involves an activity that will be score by the participant using 4-point Likert scale depending on how concerned to fall if they did this activity regardless of actual performance. The scores range from 16 to 64, with higher scores indicate a high risk of fall. This scale has been translated and validated into Arabic language (Halaweh, Svantesson, Rosberg, & Willen, 2016).",
                    "It is a 9-item, self report questionnaire measures the levels of physical activity of adult older than 50 years. The response to each item is yes or no. The instructions for completing the questionnaire provide a brief description of three levels of physical activity (light, moderate, and vigorous) with graphic and text depictions of the types of activities that fall into each category. The total score of the first seven items is from 1 to 7 points, with the respondent's score categorized into one of five levels of physical activity: 1 = sedentary, 2 = underactive, 3 = regular underactive (light activities), 4 = regular underactive, and 5 = regular active. Responses to the strength training and flexibility items are scored separately, with strength training = 1, flexibility = 2, or both = 3 (Topolski et al., 2006). This measure has been cross-culturally adapted and validated to Arabic language (Alqahtani & Alenazi, 2019).",

It has 9 items, and each item uses a Likert scale of 4 options ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A total score of 27 indicates severe depression, and a cut off score of 10 has been used to diagnose moderate depression (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002; Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2003). Previous research has found that this is a reliable and valid instrument for different populations including people with stroke (Janneke et al., 2012).

The higher score indicate greater fatigue severity (Krupp, LaRocca, Muir-Nash, & Steinberg, 1989). The mean score of the 9 items will be used for statistical analysis. The FSS has been shown to have high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and good concurrent validity in several population (Hagell et al., 2006; Learmonth et al., 2013; Lerdal & Kottorp, 2011).

Also, the patient can use any assistive device but needs to be documented. Only minimum amount of assistance is accepted if the patient needs and the level of the assistance should be documented. The examiner should walk behind the patient at least half step when the patient administrating the test.

The higher the score, the greater the degree of functional independence. The minimal clinically important differences (MCID) is 1.85 in stroke population (Hsieh et al., 2007). The BI has demonstrated useful instrument with high inter-rater reliability, internal consistency, convergent and predictive validity, and adequate responsiveness in stroke patients (Hsueh, Lee, & Hsieh, 2001). Each patient's ADL performance will be rated primarily by interviewing the patients, their primary caregiver, or their nurse. Observation of performance will be applied if necessary."
